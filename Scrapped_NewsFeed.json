  "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three of Apple Inc's AAPL.O top contract manufacturers plan to invest a total of almost $900 million in India in the next five years to tap into a new production-linked incentive plan, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nFoxconn 2317.TW, Wistron 3231.TW and Pegatron 4938.TW all plan to make investments under the scheme, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.\n\nIndia’s new $6.65 billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme offers companies cash incentives on any increase in sales of locally-made smartphones over the next five years, compared with 2019-20 levels. The scheme aims to help transform India into an export manufacturing hub.\n\nFoxconn has applied to invest about 40 billion rupees ($542 million), while Wistron and Pegatron have committed to invest close to 13 billion rupees and 12 billion rupees, respectively, under the PLI plan, the sources said.\n\nIt is unclear whether all of the investment will be targeted at boosting manufacturing of Apple devices in India, but the sources and industry insiders said the vast majority would be focused on expanding iPhone manufacturing in the country.\n\nFoxconn said that as a matter of policy it did not comment on specific operations or work for any customer. Apple, Wistron, Pegatron and India’s technology ministry, which formulated the PLI scheme, did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nWhile Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron make devices for companies other than Apple globally, Wistron’s arm in India currently assembles only iPhones.\n\nWistron, which assembles roughly 200,000 second-generation iPhone SEs per month in India, plans to scale that up to 400,000 a month by the end of the year, one of the sources said, as it looks to cater to export demand for the device.\n\nThat plan is expected to create roughly 10,000 jobs, the source added.\n\nPegatron is yet to start Indian operations, but has been in talks with several states, with Tamil Nadu in the south emerging as a frontrunner for a planned plant to manufacture Apple devices, a third source said.\n\nFoxconn, which also assembles devices for Xiaomi 1810.HK in India, already has enough capacity to meet Xiaomi's needs and is likely to use the PLI plan largely to boost iPhone production, a fourth source said.\n\nThe commitments would help Apple diversify its supply chain beyond China, which is locked in a trade war with the United States.\n\nApple started assembling in 2017 a low-cost iPhone model in India through Wistron’s local unit in the tech hub of Bengaluru. It later ramped up production, with Foxconn beginning to assemble iPhones last year and Wistron widening operations.\n\n“India is key to Apple’s global ambitions as it expands beyond China,” said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. “It offers a strategic market to them where skilled labour is cheaper as compared to other manufacturing destinations, the size of the internal market is huge and the export potential is enormous.”\n\nLocal manufacturing helps Apple save costly duties levied on imports of fully-built phones and components in India, where the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant accounts for just 1% of smartphone shipments.\n\nApple is looking to change that. It launched its online store in India last week, and is building its first company-run retail store in the financial hub of Mumbai.",

  "text": "CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In 35 years of selling the village catch, Jennet Cleetus said business has never been so bad for her and other women who make ends meet by hawking seafood along the palm-fringed coast of Kerala in southern India.\n\nIndia - one of the countries worst-hit by COVID-19 - has eased most lockdown restrictions and sought to reopen its battered economy, but some curbs on informal vendors remain and many customers are too scared to go out shopping.\n\n“First, our men couldn’t go fishing. When they did go and brought fish in, we couldn’t go and buy it. Now if we buy it, we can’t sell it outside our villages,” said Cleetus, 60, from her home in Valiya Veli in Thiruvananthapuram district.\n\nAdditional pandemic requirements are adding to their woes, she added.\n\n“The government wants us to get an antigen test, produce the certificate and get permission from the police before we can enter the markets. The test is expensive but we have to do it now or we may die of hunger.”\n\nCleetus is among the tens of thousands of women fish vendors living along India’s 7,500-kilometre (4,660-mile) coastline who are battling to regain livelihoods hit by wary buyers, online sales and persistent curbs on movement and access to markets.\n\nAn estimated 25 million people make a living from fishing and related activities in India, government data states.\n\nWomen make up nearly half of the workforce, taking a lead in the procuring, processing and marketing of fish, said S Velvizhi, who heads the Fish for All research and training centre at Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu state.\n\nTraditionally, women known as headloaders sell fish door-to-door, carrying sardines, shrimps and other local fish in bamboo baskets or aluminum vessels. Others sit on pavements or operate out of fish markets.\n\n“Many of them are single women and most of them use their income for the everyday running of their households,” said Velvizhi. “The pandemic has increased the debt burden on these women and pushed their families to the brink of poverty.”\n\nRISING DEBTS\n\nIn the middle of the lockdown, the Indian government announced broad plans to modernise the nation’s fishing industry.\n\n“One of the thrust areas of the new plan is to empower women in fisheries,” Shankar Laxman, joint commissioner in India’s Ministry of Fisheries, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n“We are aware that the pandemic has hit women fishworkers badly. The new scheme will benefit them. We are not encouraging roadside vendors anymore and will support them to set-up modern kiosks with freezers and display cabinets to sell hygienically.”\n\nLakshmi Kowada, president of the Traditional Fish Workers’ Union in Andhra Pradesh state, said he was not impressed by the government blueprint.\n\n“Today’s ground reality is that women are not able to enter apartment blocks or housing colonies to sell fish,” said Kowada, who has been in the business for 20 years, demanding immediate financial assistance for the fish sellers.\n\nWearing a mask and carrying extra water to wash her hands frequently, Maharani Selvamani went out to sell fish at a street corner in Mayiladuthurai town in Tamil Nadu state a few weeks back.\n\n“I had just bought fish worth 2,000 Indian rupees ($27) to sell but sold only 500 rupees worth,” she said.\n\n“I have never faced such losses... Police and municipal officials keep shooing us away and shifting our location,” said Selvamani, whose husband died during the lockdown.\n\nLast week, she started saving the number of regular customers on her mobile phone and sharing hers with them.\n\n“Sometimes I call them and tell them about the fish I have and where I am. I try but it doesn’t seem enough.”\n\n($1 = 73.5911 Indian rupees)",

  "text": "McLaren Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton (L) of Britain bowls as cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle watches during a Vodafone Essar promotional event in New Delhi August 1, 2009. REUTERS/Fayaz Kabli\n\nMUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - India can turn its defeat against Vodafone to its advantage. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government accepts Friday’s unanimous international arbitration ruling in favour of the British telecom operator, it can start to make good on its six-year-old pledge to end “tax terrorism” and recast itself as a better destination for global capital – and perhaps even woo some away from China.\n\nThe fight with the London-listed company has embarrassed the country’s bureaucracy. In 2012, India’s top court dismissed the government’s attempt to tax Vodafone’s 2007 takeover of the Indian mobile assets of Hong Kong’s Hutchison Telecommunications International. But New Delhi changed the law to target transactions retrospectively, ultimately claiming $3.8 billion including tax, interest and penalties. It even tried to tax the seller too.\n\nIdeally Vodafone’s victory will clear Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party to draw a line under a debacle it inherited from the prior government when it took power in 2014. It has allowed old legacy cases like Vodafone’s to run their full legal course. The administration has also preserved the controversial underlying legislation allowing for retroactive taxation, and new cases have emerged, so there’s reason to doubt the government’s intentions.\n\nAny attempt to keep enforcing this demand would seriously undermine Modi’s reform credibility. The official reaction will also set the tone for other higher-stakes disputes. Cairn Energy, for example, made one of India’s biggest oil discoveries in decades in 2004. But its exit was disrupted in 2015 after it was slapped with a tax bill for a years-old corporate reorganisation. Its shares in Vedanta India were frozen and sold off by authorities. Cairn wants $1.4 billion in compensation; a ruling is due in the coming weeks.\n\nCash-strapped politicians would be better off accepting these rulings and focusing on the bigger picture. Foreign investment plunged year-on-year between April and June. Modi is trying to pitch India as a reliable destination for multi-national companies considering rejigging their global supply chains in the light of the pandemic. But the complaints of Vodafone, Cairn and even Toyota Motor’s India partner, who earlier this month publicly slammed the broader tax regime, are discouraging to their peers. It’s time for India to walk the talk.",

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\nAn international arbitration tribunal in The Hague ruled that India’s imposition of a tax liability on Vodafone, as well as interest and penalties, were in a breach of an investment treaty agreement between India and the Netherlands, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nIndia had claimed a total of 279 billion rupees ($3.79 billion) including about $2 billion in tax, as well as interest and penalties, one of the sources said.\n\nThe tribunal, in its ruling, said the government’s demand is in breach of “fair and equitable treatment” and it must cease seeking the dues from Vodafone. It also directed India to pay 4.3 million pounds ($5.47 million) to the company as compensation for its legal costs, one of the sources added.\n\nVodafone said in a statement the amount of the award was confidential. Shares in the company's India unit, Vodafone Idea VODA.NS, ended 13% higher on Friday.\n\n“The tribunal held that any attempt by India to enforce the tax demand would be a violation of India’s international law obligations,” Vodafone said in its statement.\n\nIndia’s finance ministry said it will carefully study the award, together with its lawyers. “After such consultations, the government will consider all options and take a decision on further course of action including legal remedies,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\n“Vodafone has finally got justice first from the Indian Supreme Court and now from an international arbitral tribunal,” said Anuradha Dutt, senior partner at DMD Advocates, an Indian law firm representing the company.\n\nThe ruling brings an end to one of the most controversial disputes in India under international treaty agreements that it enters into with countries to protect foreign investments.\n\nIndia is entangled in more than a dozen such cases against companies, including Cairn Energy CNE.L, over retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts. The exchequer could end up paying billions of dollars in damages if it loses.\n\nTo reduce future arbitration claims, India has ended such agreements with over 50 countries and is working on a new law to protect foreign investors by offering relief from possible policy changes even as it upholds the right to tax them, Reuters reported.\n\nVodafone’s tax dispute stems from its $11 billion deal to buy the Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.

Ltd. could spill over into the next fiscal year, according to a government document and sources, hurting New Delhi’s efforts to rein in a ballooning fiscal deficit.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A private security guard stands in front of the regional head office of oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) in Kolkata, India, November 28, 2019. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File photo\n\nThe privatisation of key companies, including BPCL, is a key part of government plans to pare the fiscal deficit, which has breached its target level just four months into the current fiscal year. Industry sources last year estimated the government’s 53.29% stake in BPCL could fetch $8 billion to $10 billion.\n\nWith India’s economy contracting by a record 23.9% in the June quarter due to COVID-19, a delayed sale of BPCL could hinder the government’s ability to generate funds for stimulus efforts aimed at restoring growth.\n\nNew Delhi’s plan to sell its stake in BPCL was first announced in November 2019, and is part of a broader program to spin off or sell stakes in dozens of state-owned companies.\n\nThe sale has been targeted for completion in the current fiscal year at end-March, but the deadline for initial expressions of interest was pushed out by two months due to pandemic-related movement restrictions that have prevented potential buyers from inspecting the facility.\n\nA sale status report issued last month and reviewed by Reuters showed the sale was only due to complete the third step of a 25-step process established for government divestments this month. The document suggests it could take as long as another 21 months for the sale to be completed, although some stages could be carried out concurrently. Potential buyers still needed to attain security clearance, conduct valuation assessments and agree financial terms.\n\n“This looks challenging. But we are doing our best to complete the transaction in this financial year,” a senior government official familiar with the sale told Reuters.\n\nA second official said the process could take at least 7-8 months more, which would delay completion until at least the end of April, and mean that the proceeds of any sale would only hit government coffers next fiscal year, which begins on April 1\n\n“It may not be possible for overseas companies to do due diligence as air travel is restricted,” added a third official involved in the privatisation process.\n\nAll three officials declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nThe sale also faces domestic opposition. The state government of Kerala, where BPCL’s 310,000 barrels per day Kochi refinery is located, fears job losses and plans to challenge the privatisation in the Supreme Court, its industry minister EP Jayarajan told Reuters.\n\nCompanies including Saudi Aramco and Rosneft have indicated they would look at BPCL since the privatisation plan was announced.\n\nBPCL shares have fallen more than 20% since November last year. Interest may be dampened as the industry looks to shift to greener energy investments.\n\nThe government had budgeted collections of over $27 billion from privatisations and minority stake sales of state-owned companies this fiscal year, but had raised only about $775 million after the first 6 months.",

  "text": "MUMBAI/BENGALURU, (Reuters) - Indian farmers intensified their protests over three new bills that they believe could pave the way for the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers such as traders and retailers.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has defended the legislation - recently approved by India’s parliament - as reform measures that will help rid India’s vast agriculture sector of antiquated laws.\n\nModi and some of his ministers have said that the new bills would help remove middlemen from farm trade, allowing farmers to sell to institutional buyers and large retailers like Walmart.\n\nOn Thursday, farmers from some of India’s big northern heartland states - key producers of wheat and rice - blocked railway tracks, forcing authorities to cancel a few trains on some local routes.\n\nLeading farmers’ organisations have chalked out plans for bigger protests on Friday, when opposition parties from across the country are likely to join.\n\nLast week, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Modi’s minister for food processing, resigned over her opposition to the bills that she termed as “anti-farmer”.\n\nBadal’s regional party, an ally of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and India’s opposition parties have said that farmers would lose their bargaining power if large private traders and retailers are allowed to buy directly from growers.\n\nFarm Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday accused opposition parties of misleading farmers and said the government would continue to buy grain from farmers at government-set guaranteed prices.\n\nIn the southern state of Karnataka, several farmers’ organisations have called for a shutdown on Sept. 28 to protest “anti-farmer” policies of the state and federal governments, said Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president of the Karnataka State Farmers Association.\n\n“If we don’t protest now fearing coronavirus, these policies will claim a thousand more farmers’ lives than what COVID will,” Chandrashekar said.",

  "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Business groups on Thursday welcomed contentious and long-delayed labour reforms passed by India’s parliament this week, aimed at making hiring and firing workers easier and imposing restrictions on trade unions.\n\nPeople hold placards as they attend a protest organised by various trade unions against labour law changes and the disinvestment and privatisation of public sector enterprises, in New Delhi, September 23, 2020. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nThe reforms to India’s decades-old labour laws are a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s moves to liberalise conditions for investment. But they have met with resistance from trade unions that plan to join a nationwide agitation on Friday against these and several other bills passed by the government.\n\nThree key bills on labour reform were approved by India’s upper house of parliament late on Wednesday, and will become law after receiving presidential approval. They were approved by the decision-making lower house on Tuesday.\n\n“This change is welcome and bound to create more attraction for foreign investments in small-scale sectors,” said KE Raghunathan, convener of Consortium of Indian Associations, an umbrella group representing small businesses.\n\n“At the same time, workers might fear losing their rights in certain cases, and the onus is on the employers to make sure this feeling is eliminated.”\n\nUnder the Industrial Relations Code, one of the three new laws, companies employing up to 300 workers will not require government permission to lay off workers or close plants - an increase from the previous cap of 100 and a major demand from industry over the years.\n\nThe code also puts restrictions on the recognition of trade unions - making it mandatory for them to represent at least 10% of workers in a given sector - and prohibit them from striking without prior notice and during conciliation proceedings.\n\nBusinessman Vinod Kumar, who employs just over 100 people at his factory making parts for India’s Tata Motors in the north Indian city of Lucknow, said the code will help him to expand operations.\n\n“This will give us some power and rein in the labour unions, who have now a habit of blackmailing us in the name of increasing remuneration,” he said.\n\nRick Rossow, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, who specialises in U.S.-India business ties, said the reforms were likely to prove attractive to overseas investors.\n\n“Foreign companies have long listed India’s stifling labor regulations as a key deterrent to making larger investments,” he said.\n\nThe northern state of Rajasthan, that introduced similar laws for companies with fewer than 300 workers in 2014, has seen an increase in the average number of employees, he added.\n\nIndian state governments are allowed to pass their own labour laws, but the new codes issued by the federal government will over-ride these.\n\nSix states have this year already relaxed labour laws, including raising caps on work hours, in what they say is an attempt to kick-start their economies badly damaged by the novel coronavirus pandemic, to the concern of groups including the United Nations’ labour wing.\n\nAmarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, one of the biggest trade unions in the country, said the new codes will make it would be almost impossible for workers at small industrial units to form a trade union.\n\n“Workers will be at the mercy of their employers who could fire them for any flimsy reason,” she said.\n\nAITUC, along with at least 10 major trade unions, will launch nation-wide protests against the labour code, and will join farmers on Friday to protest against the government, she added.",

  "text": "MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When India began lifting its coronavirus lockdown, Meera, a child bride from northwestern India, was focused on just one thing: when she could start playing football again.\n\nIn Rajasthan, one of the Indian regions where early marriage persists despite being outlawed more than a decade ago, a girls’ soccer initiative is tackling gender inequality, and giving child brides the confidence to fight for their rights.\n\n“The day I was married, I was supposed to go to my first football camp. I protested, but my father didn’t listen to me,” the soccer-crazy 15-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n\n“I’m more assertive now. I’m no longer shy. I started playing again about a month ago... The question of me leaving does not arise,” said Meera, who was married three years ago in a mass wedding along with her two sisters.\n\nIn keeping with the usual practice for girls married early in Rajasthan, most child brides do not have their ‘gauna’ - the ritual sending off to live with their husband and in-laws - until they turn 18, the legal marriage age in India.\n\nBut as the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and deepened rural hardship in one of the world’s worst-hit countries, Meera feared the ‘gauna’ might come early for girls in her village.\n\nUNICEF data from 2018 found that about 27% of girls in India get married before they turn 18, down from 47% a decade earlier, but advocates have warned that the COVID-19 crisis could lead to a spike in child marriage and put paid to recent progress.\n\nOf 223 million women and girls in India who were married off as children, almost half were wed before turning 15, according to statistics by the United Nations’ children’s agency UNICEF.\n\n‘SEEN THE WORLD’\n\nMeera and her team-mates got their first taste of the Beautiful Game thanks to a programme launched four years ago by the non-profit Mahila Jan Adhikar Samiti (MJAS), which aimed to fight child marriage and help girls achieve their dreams.\n\nIt focuses on four villages in the Ajmer district of Rajasthan where early marriage is common.\n\nWhen Indira Pancholi, founder of MJAS and joint head of the Girls Not Brides Rajasthan Alliance, got funding for a sport-based initiative, she went out to ask girls which was their favourite game, only to find most had never played anything.\n\nBut in the end, they opted for soccer.\n\n“We didn’t know why they chose football, but realised from their conversations that they wanted to run in an open ground,” Pancholi said.\n\nMore than a quarter of the 170 girls who belong to Meera’s team were also married as children or engaged to be married.\n\nWhen the coronavirus lockdown brought India to a virtual standstill in March, Sudhir Joseph, joint secretary at the Rajasthan Football Association, which coaches the girls, said he worried that many of them would give up.\n\n“I was scared they would drop out... But they are still interested,” he said, adding that the game had boosted the girls’ confidence and broadened their horizons by allowing them to travel for games.\n\n“Football took them out of their homes... they have seen the world outside their villages,” he said.\n\nWhen Rashi, 17, returned from her first football camp wearing shorts and a t-shirt and not the wide skirt, blouse and long scarf that she had set off in, her parents reacted angrily.\n\n“The villagers protested and said the campaigners were sullying us by making us play a boys’ game. Even girls who were not playing would say we were sullied,” said Rashi, who was married two years ago and declined to give her real name.\n\nDetermined not to be cowed, they started wearing leggings under their shorts.\n\nLittle by little, parents and neighbours began to accept the football-playing girls as they brought trophies home from local tournaments or matches in big cities.\n\n“We live in a remote village, so we had no idea what this (girls playing football) was... we couldn’t trust the girls going out on their own,” said Ramlal Bhadana, a member of Hasiyawas village council in Rajasthan.\n\n“But the girls never missed a day of practice, even now... and they started doing well in studies. Five girls from our village are studying in college,” he said.\n\n‘COURAGE TO SPEAK UP’\n\nPancholi said football had turned out to be a “great strategy”, highlighting the success of convincing the girls’ families to let them take part in week-long camps.\n\nThe camps were liberating, Meera said, recalling how they allowed her to improve her technique and strategy on the pitch while also learning about child marriage laws, career options and meeting legal officials from her home district.\n\nMeera, who wants to train to become a football coach when she finishes school, spent some of her free time during lockdown visiting local families to encourage them to send their daughters to play. She said much still needs to be done.\n\n“I want them to have the courage to speak up and not get trapped in marriage,” she said.\n\n“Besides, if more of us step out, it would become normal for the villagers to see girls playing.”",

  "text": "(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - India’s government is using the coronavirus pandemic to push its plan to digitise the health records and data of its 1.3 billion people, despite concerns about privacy and increased surveillance, technology and human rights experts say.\n\nIndia’s number of confirmed coronavirus cases have topped 5.4 million according to government data, with the virus spreading at one of the fastest paces in the world.\n\nIn a speech last month to mark Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the launch of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), under which unique Health IDs will be created to hold digital health records of individuals.\n\n“Whether it is making a doctor’s appointment, depositing money or running around for documents in the hospital, the Mission will help remove all such challenges,” Modi said.\n\nPraveen Gedam of the National Health Authority (NHA) said in emailed comments that the pandemic had highlighted the need to “move swiftly to improve medical infrastructure”.\n\nBut without a data protection law or an independent data protection authority, there are few safeguards and no recourse if rights are violated, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now, a digital rights non-profit.\n\n“It will possibly be the largest centralised health ID and data storage system in the world, and it is being done in the absence of a data protection law and data protection authority,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n“Health is a state subject, but the central government is rushing this policy in the middle of a public health emergency, and forcing states to play ball. It’s very problematic.”\n\nThere has been a move in recent years to digitise medical records and data as part of the Digital India campaign to deliver services electronically. A federal medical insurance scheme aimed at 500 million people launched in 2018.\n\nA draft Health Data Management Policy unveiled last month has guidelines for regulating the collection and storage of the data that can only be accessed with the individual’s consent.\n\nThe aim of the NDHM is to create and maintain registries that are portable and accessible across India to everyone associated with healthcare delivery, according to the draft.\n\nThe new Health ID, which the health minister said will be “entirely voluntary” with an opt-out option, will hold information such as tests, prescriptions, treatments and medical records.\n\nGedam of the NHA, which oversees the NDHM, said that “the policy has been years in the making and undergone multiple rounds of consultation. Hence it is incorrect to assume that this has been a rushed undertaking”.\n\nMATTER OF CONCERN\n\nIt has been more than a decade since India created Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric identity system, with more than 1.2 billion IDs issued.\n\nThe 12-digit ID, which is linked to an individual’s fingerprints, face and iris scan, was introduced to streamline welfare payments and reduce wastage in public spending. Yet it soon became mandatory for a host of public and private services.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that Aadhaar could not be a requirement for welfare programmes. In 2018, the top court flagged privacy concerns and reined in a government push to make it compulsory for everything from mobile services to pensions.\n\nThe government has repeatedly denied charges of data misuse or surveillance, even as large numbers of people remain excluded and many are denied essential services, a report by consulting firm Dalberg said last year.\n\nThe new Health ID has the potential to be made mandatory and deny services to those who opt out, while also posing the risk of data abuse, human rights campaigners say.\n\nThe draft policy is only available online and in English, thus preventing access to a large majority of people, said Satendra Singh, a physician and disability rights campaigner who petitioned to extend the deadline for feedback to Sept. 21.\n\nThe policy also allows the sharing of anonymised data with third parties - “a matter of grave concern”, particularly for sexual minorities and those with disabilities, he said.\n\n“The privacy implications of such data sharing requires in-depth examination because anonymised data can be identified if combined with other data sets such as voter records,” he said.\n\n“This could be more problematic as we do not have a data protection law yet,” he added.\n\nPrivacy of data will receive “the highest degree of attention”, said Gedam.\n\n“The draft Policy draws from provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill and will be kept compliant with any future legislations and rulings,” he added, referring to the draft bill that was tabled in Parliament last year.\n\nTRACING APP\n\nIndia’s public and private hospitals, clinics and labs have varying levels of digitisation, and patients usually cannot digitally transfer their health records from one to another.\n\nPrivate healthcare providers have long argued that lack of digitisation and interoperability leads to delays, inconvenience and higher costs.\n\nLike several other nations, India quickly embraced technology to track and trace the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Aarogya Setu, or “Health Bridge” mobile app uses GPS location data to augment information gathered via Bluetooth and build a centralised database - an approach avoided by most countries because of privacy concerns.\n\nWhile use of the app is voluntary, it has been made mandatory for food-delivery workers, government and some private sector employees, for public transit and airports.\n\nMore than 100,000 Health IDs have already been created in six federal territories, and made mandatory for doctors in government hospitals in at least one city, according to local media reports.\n\nThe experience with Aadhaar and Aarogya Setu - and the Health ID pilot - does not inspire confidence, said Amulya Nidhi, co-convenor of the People’s Health Movement (Jan Swasthya Abhiyan) non-profit.\n\n“At a time when we are struggling for hospital beds and oxygen, the government is focusing on digitisation,” he said.\n\n“People’s vulnerability while seeking health services may be misused to get consent. Informed consent is a real issue when people are poor, illiterate or desperate,” he said.\n\nIt is also an issue for vulnerable populations such as those living with HIV; if they are worried that their data may be exposed, they may shun medical care completely, said Chima.\n\n“The government says it wants to do analytics and trend forecasting to improve the healthcare system - that is a form of health surveillance,” he said.\n\n“Your health data - once it’s out there, it’s out there. You can’t do anything about it.”",

  "text": "ST. HELENA, Calif. (Reuters) - A wind-driven wildfire erupted on Sunday in the heart of northern California’s Napa Valley wine country to spread across nearly 2,000 acres (809 hectares), forcing the evacuation of a hospital and hundreds of homes, authorities said.\n\nFire crews were out in force, scrambling to fend off flames threatening neighborhoods and vineyards at the northern end of the famed wine-growing valley and surrounding hillsides, about 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco.\n\nThe blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, broke out before dawn near Calistoga and raced toward the adjacent communities of Deer Park and St. Helena, with flames reaching within a mile of the Adventist Health St. Helena hospital.\n\nAll 55 patients there at the time were safely evacuated by ambulance and helicopter over the course of five hours from about 7 a.m., hospital spokeswoman Linda Williams told Reuters.\n\n“We had ambulances lined up from all over the Bay area,” she said, adding that although smoke shrouded the facility, the skies above were clear enough for helicopters’ airlift efforts.\n\nIt was the second wildfire-related evacuation of the 151-bed hospital in a month, after a massive cluster of lightning-sparked blazes that swept several counties north of the San Francisco Bay region in August.\n\nAuthorities ordered about 600 homes evacuated on Sunday, with residents of 1,400 more warned to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice, said Tyree Zander, a spokesman for the state’s forestry and fire protection department (CalFire). The notices affected at least 5,000 people, he added.\n\nBy evening, flames stoked by winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph) had scorched about 1,800 acres (728 hectares) of grassy rolling hillsides and oak woodlands, with little or no containment, Zander said.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nFIRE AT HARVEST TIME\n\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but a Reuters photographer in St. Helena saw some structures that had been burned.\n\nThe blaze erupted midway through the traditional grape-harvesting period in the Napa Valley, world renowned as one of California’s premiere wine-producing regions. The area’s 475 wineries account for just 4% of the state’s total annual grape harvest but half of the retail value of all California wines sold, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.\n\nOf Napa’s 16 wine-growing districts, or sub-appellations, the Howell Mountain area may have faced the greatest threat, said Lisa Covey, a spokeswoman for Hall Family Wines, which kept open during the day all its three tasting rooms in the county.\n\nNapa and other wine-growing regions have been hit by wildfires in and around the Bay area for several years. Susan Krausz, co-owner of Arkenstone Estate Vineyards in the Howell Mountain community of Angwin, said it would take days or weeks to assess the impact of the latest blaze on valley vintners.\n\n“Most people have harvested,” she said, but added, “Any time’s a bad time for a fire.”\n\nTom Kaljian, 78, a realtor who owns a house about halfway between Calistoga and St. Helena, defied evacuation orders to spend the day with his wife hosing down their home and dry brush along a fence line separating their property from the Silverado Trail, a key north-south roadway.\n\n“We were told to get out of here, but I was trying to protect our little abode, so we stayed,” he told Reuters by telephone.\n\nAfter firefighters told him the house was no longer in danger, he added, “I stopped watering at that point, and came in and took a nap.”\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nThe Glass Fire came as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it was temporarily halting power to transmission lines in parts of 16 counties across northern and central California to guard against greater wildfire risks in hot, windy, dry weather.\n\nThe public safety power shutoffs were expected to affect about 65,000 regional homes and businesses, said PG&E, the state’s largest electric utility.\n\nA red flag warning for extreme wildfire risks for Napa Valley would run through Monday morning, Zander said.\n\nCalFire said a fire weather watch would start on Monday across much of Southern California, following the forecast return of hot, gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidity.\n\nCalifornia wildfires have scorched more than 3.7 million acres in the first nine months of 2020, far exceeding any single year in state history, killing 26 people and destroying more than 7,000 structures.",

  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Big Hit Entertainment, the management label of hugely popular South Korean K-Pop group BTS, priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its range on Monday, as hopeful buyers chased South Korea’s largest listing in three years.\n\nInstitutional investors expressed interest in more than 1,000 times the number of shares on offer, with Big Hit riding on the success of the seven-member band, which has become the first South Korean group to reach No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with song “Dynamite”.\n\nAn army of retail investors, known in South Korea as Ants, is also clamouring to buy stock, while die-hard BTS fans are bidding in hopes of securing even one share in what analysts expect to the country’ hottest listing this year.\n\nBig Hit priced the IPO at 135,000 won ($115) per share, it said in a regulatory filing, the top of an indicative price range of 105,000-135,000 won announced earlier this month.\n\nSome 1,420 institutional investors sought shares in pre-subscription offers, looking for 1,117 times the number available, the filing said. About 98% said they would pay the top-range price or more.\n\n“Big Hit is classified as a kind of global export firm,” said Park Sung-ho, analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.\n\n“Not only has it proven its ability to use Youtube, social media for smart market infiltration, it has fandom platform Weverse which gives unprecedented clarity and control over its revenue sources for a label, and may grow into a true platform player as outside artists increasingly join.”\n\nBig Hit reported a 49.7 billion won ($42.4 million) profit for the first half of 2020 as its online concert and merchandise sales on the Weverse app more than offset event cancellations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe IPO will make the seven BTS members multimillionaire stockholders, as Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk in August gave them 68,385 shares each, worth nearly $7.9 million at the issue price.\n\nThe firm will raise 962.6 billion won ($820 million) through the offer of 7.13 million new shares, the biggest South Korean IPO since Celltrion Healthcare raised 1 trillion won in 2017.\n\nThe pricing values Big Hit at about 4.8 trillion won, taking into account common shares plus redeemable preferred shares that will be converted into common shares upon the IPO.\n\nWith plenty of liquidity in the market, some analysts predict gross bids from retail investors could hit 100 trillion won ($85 billion).\n\nThe central bank is watching the offer closely as a massive oversubscription for shares could send ripples through short-term money markets.\n\nInstitutional and retail investors’ subscriptions are due on Oct. 5-6 and Big Hit is expected to list on the KOSPI on Oct. 15.\n\n($1 = 1,173.0400 won)",

  "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. businesses with COVID-19 outbreaks are facing an emerging legal threat from claims that workers brought coronavirus home and infected relatives, which one risk analysis firm said could cost employers billions of dollars.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A volunteer places American flags representing some of the 200,000 lives lost in the United States in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the National Mall in Washington, U.S., September 22, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nThe daughter of Esperanza Ugalde of Illinois filed in August what lawyers believe is the first wrongful death “take home” lawsuit, alleging her mother died of COVID-19 that her father contracted at Aurora Packing Co’s meat processing plant.\n\nThe cases borrow elements from “take home” asbestos litigation and avoid caps on liability for workplace injuries, exposing business to costly pain and suffering damages, even though the plaintiff never set foot on their premises.\n\n“Businesses should be very concerned about these cases,” said labor and employment attorney Tom Gies of Crowell & Moring, which defends employers.\n\nThe lawsuit against Aurora alleges that Ricardo Ugalde worked “shoulder to shoulder” on the company’s processing line in April when Aurora knew it had a coronavirus outbreak at its facility and failed to warn employees or adopt any infection prevention measures.\n\nAurora did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBetween 7% and 9% of the roughly 200,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths so far are believed to stem from take-home infections and the lawsuits could cost businesses up to $21 billion if the number of Americans fatalities reaches 300,000, according to Praedicat, a firm that evaluates risks for insurers.\n\nRob Reville, Praedicat’s chief executive, cautions that is a worst-case scenario and said the cases might cost far less, depending on how judges view the lawsuits.\n\nThe U.S. workers compensation system generally makes it difficult for workers to sue for COVID-19. The system caps liability for businesses and bars costly lawsuits in return for quick payments to employees, who do not need to prove fault.\n\nBut Esperanza Ugalde was not an employee of Aurora, so her family can sue the company. Depending on the circumstances, a successful wrongful death case can top $1 million in damages.\n\nTake-home cases have been around for decades in asbestos litigation and courts have split on whether a business has an obligation to members of the public who have never been on their premises.\n\nIn 2013, a California jury awarded Rose-Marie Griggs $27.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages after she contracted mesothelioma that her lawyers argued was caused by asbestos fibers carried home in the 1950s on the work clothes of her then-husband, who installed insulation for an affiliate of Owens-Illinios Inc.\n\nThe company appealed and two sides reached a private settlement before the appeal was heard.\n\nCONTESTING THE ‘CAUSAL CHAIN’\n\nAttorneys for both plaintiffs and companies said successful cases require a strong “causal chain” linking the sick family member to the worker and then to the business and the business’s alleged failure to adopt safety measures.\n\nMiriam Alvarez Reynoso sued Byrne & Schaefer Inc, a manufacturer of electrical components in Lockport, Illinois, alleging negligence by the company led to her contracting COVID-19 and suffering “serious injuries to multiple organs.”\n\nReynoso’s lawsuit says she became infected while caring for her husband Servando Reynoso, a parts assembler at the company, who came home sick from work on April 8. It lists 18 categories of alleged shortcomings by Byrne & Schaefer, including failing to clean work areas and ignoring employees who said they had COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nCompany owner Tim Byrne said his five employees wore masks routinely before the pandemic to protect against dust and regularly used gloves.\n\n“He was sick before anyone else,” said Byrne. “It’s difficult to prove after the fact.”\n\nLawyers said employers would likely be reluctant to settle the cases for significant sums until claims were vetted in the court system.\n\nPeter Wozniak, an attorney with Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers, said the cases will test juror attitudes toward the behavior of plaintiffs, who need to show they protected themselves from other sources of infection.\n\n“Are you always wearing a mask? Are you staying six feet away? Are you washing your hands,” he said. “It will be interesting and unpredictable with regards to people’s attitudes for individual responsibility.”\n\nThe best protection for business owners will be adopting and documenting measures to protect workers.\n\n“If they had acted reasonably and if Aurora put these things in place prior to the death of Esperanza I don’t know if I would have taken the case,” said Bridget Duignan, who represents Ugalde’s daughter.\n\n“But they did nothing.”",

  "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects across markets, and investors are already trying to identify potential winners and losers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers a speech on the U.S. Supreme Court at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., September 27, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBroadly speaking, analysts say Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes could pressure company earnings. But they expect him to support infrastructure projects and renewable energy.\n\nA second Trump term, meanwhile, may bring more tax cuts and extend de-regulation that could benefit the energy and financial sectors, while risking continued tensions with China.\n\nWith the Senate majority also at stake, the election could allow one party to control the presidency and Congress, making it easier to enact legislation such as the additional fiscal stimulus currently being held up in a political standoff.\n\nHere is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:\n\nBIDEN BASKET\n\nALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A stronger expected “green energy” push under a Biden administration could support alternative energy stocks. For example, tax credit extensions would provide a boost for solar stocks such as Sunnova Energy International, SunPower Corp and Enphase Energy, according to Credit Suisse.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES: Tesla shares already have had a mammoth run during the Trump administration, but some believe a Biden presidency could further fuel the electric vehicle company’s shares.\n\n“Biden has proposed new tax incentives, government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs in particular,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in a report.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nOther potential winners from a Biden victory would be auto suppliers focused on electrification and green, emission-free technologies, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner and Visteon, Nelson wrote.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE: A large infrastructure spending package “may be an early priority for a Biden administration as it seeks a bipartisan win,” according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nBiden’s plan would boost a broad group of engineering and construction companies, with AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group and MasTec among the biggest beneficiaries, according to Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz.\n\nTARIFF TRADE: A Biden administration could see a calming of the U.S.-China tariff war. “Should trade policy be less-focused on the use of tariffs, both importers and exporters may benefit,” according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nJP Morgan in a July report listed Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher and 3M among a number of stocks that could outperform should a Biden presidency lead to a “de-escalation” in U.S.-China tariff tensions.\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nTAX RELIEF: A Biden loss could spell additional relief for companies that benefited from the president’s corporate tax cuts.\n\nIn its July report, JP Morgan listed AT&T, Target and Waste Management among companies that benefited from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could underperform in a Biden presidency.\n\nBANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration, particularly if a progressive such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a high-profile role.\n\nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say a Trump win with Republicans retaining the Senate is the best election scenario for banks, noting “the Republican agenda of reduced regulation remains intact.” Stocks to own in that scenario include Wells Fargo and Citigroup, KBW wrote.\n\nDEFENSE: Trump would probably “succeed in maintaining large defense spending, despite a Democratic House, given the reality of great power struggle with China and Russia,” BCA Research strategists said in a recent report.\n\nFOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES: “Support for energy companies and specifically fossil fuels appears to be an ongoing objective for Trump,” according to LPL’s Detrick. He added that most companies in this sector, excluding those in renewable energy, will likely benefit from a Trump victory.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined “at this time” to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols’ detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it “will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.”\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump’s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his “blessing.”\n\nBut key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its “ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.”\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational”.\n\n“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on “bullying and extortion”.\n\nTrump’s administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.”\n\nAnother U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings’ WeChat from U.S. app stores.",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

WPX shares rose as much as 11.5% in early trading to $4.95, while Devon was up 4.7% at $9.23.\n\n“Sector consolidation remains a critical focus, though we think news of a DVN/WPX combination is somewhat unexpected and could be complicated by likely shareholder votes on both sides given relatively similar market caps,” Cowen analysts said.\n\nDevon's deal is the second big merger after a price shock in April. In July, Chevron Corp CVX.N agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc NBL.O for $5 billion.\n\nDevon said the deal, expected to close in early 2021, will help cut costs and increase annual cash flow by $575 million by the end of next year.\n\nThe combined company, in which Devon will own 57% stake, will hold 400,000 net acres in the Delaware and can produce 277,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nIt will pay dividends using a “fixed plus variable” strategy, issuing a set 11 cents per share per quarter along with up to 50% of the remaining free cash flow.\n\nSuch a payout plan is seen as a new model for the industry that has fallen out of favor with investors after years of poor returns.\n\nAs part of the deal, WPX shareholders will get 0.5165 shares of Devon common stock for each share of WPX common stock owned.",

JPM.N, the country's largest lender, is stepping up payment fraud protections for its small and mid-sized business customers, which continue to be targeted by scammers - particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\n\nFour-in-five small and mid-sized companies say they were targets of payment fraud last year, but that could be reduced if businesses use more tools to detect suspicious payments early, JPMorgan executives told Reuters.\n\nThe bank’s new self-service “fraud hub,” being introduced on Monday, will allow them to set alerts for unusually large payments and control who gets paid. The service supplements the current system in which customers call the bank to set controls.\n\n“Fraud is a major concern and can be devastating for businesses,” said Jennifer Roberts, chief executive of Chase Business Banking. “We want to provide them with safeguards that are easy to set up and customize for their transactions.”\n\nThe measures come amid a broader industry campaign to get businesses to be more vigilant against a major source of payment fraud: legitimate-looking emails, often impersonating the chief executive, with bogus instructions for paying suppliers or other third parties.\n\nThese email scams cost companies $1.7 billion last year, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and have been on the rise as fraudsters attempt to exploit uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile big companies are frequent targets of scammers, smaller companies tend to be more vulnerable because they have less sophisticated internal controls.\n\nTo help small businesses spot vulnerabilities, the bank is offering to add a “safety meter” to customer account dashboards which graphically shows how they score on setting safeguards, including suspicious transaction alerts.\n\nSince the advent of paper checks, banks have encouraged customers to take steps to thwart fraud. That remains important because about 40% of business-to-business payments are still made by check, according to the Association for Financial Professionals.\n\nBut the move toward fast digital payments has increased the need for much stronger controls, said Jennifer Barker, a wholesale payments executive at JPMorgan. For JPMorgan, less fraud should make for happier customers and save the bank the cost and hassle of having to recover funds.",

  "text": "Toshiba's used-memory chips are seen at an electronics shop in Tokyo November 9, 2010. Japan's Toshiba Corp stuck to its full-year operating profit forecast, keeping it below market expectations, citing concerns about an increasingly murky economic outlook, despite brisk chip sales.\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The reason for Kioxia’s decision to pull its $3.2 billion initial public offering on the eve of pricing depends on who you ask. The world’s second largest maker of flash memory chips said it was down to market volatility and pandemic uncertainties. Analysts highlighted the punchy valuation sought. Others pointed to the problems of its sales to Huawei, battered by U.S.-China trade tensions. Whatever the reason, the biggest loser is Japan’s Toshiba, which needed a pick-me-up.\n\nThe conglomerate holds 40% of the shares in Kioxia, known as Toshiba Memory until its parent was forced to spin it out in a 2018 scramble for survival. A consortium headed by Boston buyout shop Bain owns most of the rest. Toshiba’s shares fell 3% on Monday and have shed a fifth of their value since Kioxia won approval to list in Tokyo a month ago. Toshiba’s market capitalisation is languishing below $12 billion, or a mere 9 times its expected earnings.\n\nA well-received IPO would have reassured investors that Toshiba was making progress with its challenges, from its governance to restructuring. Last month 43% of shareholders supported adding Singapore-based activist Effissimo Capital Management to the board while Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani won his reelection with 58% support, well short of a robust endorsement. A botched shareholder meeting, while not Toshiba’s fault, has not helped perceptions.\n\nRestructuring stories generate initial excitement that can fizzle amid the details. It doesn’t help either that the scandal-plagued company is focused on industries whose long lead-times make it harder to assess any change. Key deals that may have sparked interest, such as a speculated buyout of its Toshiba Tec subsidiary - or a sale - haven’t materialised either.\n\nShares should rally if Toshiba wins re-entry into the closely-tracked Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section – confirmation is expected shortly. Toshiba stood to double the book value of the remainder of its holding in the chipmaker after pocketing up to $1.4 billion from selling shares. It needs this sort of simple positive story to power its turnaround and to keep activists off its back. The short-circuit of its chip IPO isn’t going to help.",

Running Commerzbank is one of the least enviable jobs in banking. Yet the 5 billion euro group’s incoming here Chief Executive Manfred Knof at least has experience of working at a bloated, dysfunctional German lender – he joins from Deutsche Bank, where he ran the domestic retail operations. The task is huge: steer Commerz through the fog of coronavirus bad debt, close little-used branches, prune the commercial bank, and eventually fashion a merger – potentially with his current employer.\n\nThe question is whether he’ll really be the one calling the shots given the bank’s noisy board and investor base. In addition to new Chairman Hans-Joerg Vetter, there’s pushy U.S. fund Cerberus Capital Management, powerful labour unions and a 16% government shareholder. As if starting a job in the middle of a pandemic wasn’t already hard enough. (By Liam Proud)\n\nRED OR BLACK. Lockdowns this year emptied out William Hill’s betting shops, and pushed punters onto the UK bookie’s smartphone app. Many appear to have also piled into the company’s stock on Friday. Shares rose about 43% after it disclosed here that buyout firm Apollo Global Management and U.S. casino operator Caesars Entertainment had both made takeover approaches.\n\nEven at the time, that seemed excessive. Sure enough, William Hill and Caesars said on Monday here that the possible cash offer was more like 2.9 billion pounds, below the 3.3 billion pounds level to which punters had bid up the price. Caesars Chief Executive Tom Reeg has also pulled a canny move: He’ll ditch a U.S. joint venture if Apollo buys the bookie, essentially destroying the William Hill investment case. A bidding war appears unlikely. Punters had better stick with soccer. (By Liam Proud)\n\nCHINA ACCELERATES. The world’s largest car market can almost see the slowdown in its rear-view mirror. The pandemic followed a painful contraction in industry sales in 2019, and pent-up demand from buyers might have fuelled a recent recovery. But as executives gather in person for the Auto China show, there are grounds for optimism. After five months of sales growth, some carmakers, including Toyota Motor, forecast positive figures in the market for the full year.\n\nSpoils aren’t evenly spread. Big, bling models and cleaner cars are ahead. The latest data dump showed sales of new-energy vehicles up by around a quarter in August, compared to a year earlier. Consumers’ plans to buy premium rides were “off the charts” in Bernstein’s September survey. Yet the same research reported close to half the respondents delaying purchases, while a third reduced their budget. The mass market isn’t quite a full throttle. (By Katrina Hamlin)",

  "text": "A girl holds a U.S. flag next to a sculpture after a naturalization ceremony at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York July 22, 2014. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors worried about a dispute over this year’s U.S. presidential election had better plan for months of market maneuvers. The Bush v. Gore legal fight 20 years ago is a tame example. A confused, knife-edge late 19th century battle may be more relevant: The winner emerged only in March, just before the inauguration.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and incumbent rival Donald Trump are gearing up for a brawl. The former vice president is building his legal team. Trump said on Wednesday that he’ll see what happens when asked to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses.\n\nUsing the 2000 battle as a roadmap of how markets may react downplays the risks. A recount in Florida left the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the Democrat who won the popular ballot but was four electoral-college votes behind, in limbo for five weeks. The S&P 500 Index fell about 8% during that period. A U.S. Supreme Court decision favored Bush, and Gore conceded on Dec. 13.\n\nThe 1876 election dragged on much longer. Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote against Republican Rutherford Hayes, but electoral votes for Tilden in four states were disputed. Florida and two others submitted two results that declared both men winners. Congress set up a commission in January 1877 to resolve the matter amid worries there could be another civil war. A compromise declared Hayes the winner on March 2, mere days before the inauguration deadline back then, and the following day he was sworn in behind closed doors to avoid the risk of an uprising.\n\nFast forward, and the jump in mail-in ballots because of Covid-19 increases the likelihood of something similar. Swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have Democratic governors and Republican legislatures, may not be done counting by a Dec. 8 deadline to certify electors for the college whose votes decide who becomes president.\n\nThat could prompt state submissions of both Trump and Biden as winners, which would move the action to Congress. If party control there is divided as it is now, that could mean further delays naming the next commander-in-chief. That’s aside from legal challenges that would also slow things down.\n\nTechnology supercharges the potential tension. Disinformation spread on Facebook and elsewhere could spur confusion and even violence. That makes the possibility of an election limbo even more fraught for investors.",

The $150 billion grocer, where members can stock up on bulk bargains such as 13.5-pound bags of baking soda or 30 lobster tails, said Friday it spent $281 million on coronavirus-related costs during the quarter ending Aug. 30.\n\nThe pandemic has mostly been good for the retailer, as penny-pinching consumers, hoarding, and eating more at home increased revenue about 12%. That pushed gross margins up and sent earnings per share 27% higher.\n\nBut the market expects earnings growth in bulk from Costco – it trades at 36 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, or twice peers, according to Refinitiv. Paying workers a bonus of $2 an hour to compensate for Covid risk adds up. These costs may stick for the rest of the pandemic – and when they disappear, the question will be whether extra shoppers do too. (By Robert Cyran)\n\nFASHION VICTIMS. Boohoo’s supply chain cleanup is as cheap as its throwaway skirts and shoes. Shares in the 4.5 billion pound retailer soared nearly 20% on Friday even though an independent audit into its treatment of workers found “many failings” in its supply chain. The review could have been worse. Media reports alleged in July that Boohoo suppliers were failing to pay staff in Leicester the minimum wage or keep them safe from the spread of Covid-19.\n\nInvestors feared the Manchester-based online retailer would have to implement a series of costly reforms that could have forced it to source stock from international suppliers in Cambodia or Turkey. Boohoo reckons the cost of implementing the changes shouldn’t exceed the 10 million pounds it previously earmarked. As this is just over 10% of its 2020 pre-tax profit, it looks like a cheap way to tick the ESG box. (By Aimee Donnellan)\n\nFRENCH PILE-UP. Media conglomerate Lagardere is becoming an increasingly crowded house. On Friday, shares in the Paris Match publisher rose by 26% after LVMH owner Bernard Arnault – a longstanding pal of eponymous Lagardere boss Arnaud – revealed a stake of over 5%. This potentially pits him against activist shareholders Amber Capital and Vivendi-owner Vincent Bolloré, who are agitating for board seats.\n\nInvestors appear to be hoping for a lucrative kiss-and-break-up. True, loss-making Lagardere’s main profit generator – its omnipresent French travel retail kiosks – has been whacked by the pandemic. But Arnault, who already owns a stake in Lagardere’s holding company, might be interested in those plus the company’s media assets, which include influential business newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. And Bolloré could take publishing arm Hachette. Still, any sales would have to pass by Lagardere himself, who controls the business via an archaic legal structure. Shareholder excitement looks premature. (By Christopher Thompson)\n\nWAVING, NOT DROWNING. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect pipeline is back. The troubled initiative, launched in 2015 to forge trading ties between the UK and China, has recorded its third offering in the British capital. Hydroelectric group China Yangtze Power secured $2 billion in global depositary receipts via a secondary listing.\n\nThe $61 billion issuer gets capital at a small discount to its Shanghai-listed shares without having to negotiate Chinese capital controls. Global funds get exposure to a sector that gains from President Xi Jinping’s banishing of carbon emissions by 2060. That said, after pricing at the bottom of the range, the final amount is well below the maximum $3.4 billion the company initially hoped to raise.\n\nStill, Covid-19 market jitters and tensions between London and Beijing over Hong Kong mean it’s an achievement to get the deal away at all. The rapprochement may indicate that it’s even harder for Chinese companies to raise capital in the United States. (By George Hay)\n\nNOT SO FAST. China’s domestic rebound is not rubbing off so much on its emerging market peers. For them, after an initial burst of growth, all the signs point to a slower pace of recovery, say Capital Economics researchers. They note two main problems. First, exports will remain weak as the developed world economies shift into slower gear. Second, in places like India and much of Latin America, new cases remain high, spurring precautionary behaviour even where lockdown restrictions have eased.\n\nThe difference is stark. A China Activity Proxy, compiled by the London-based research group, suggests economic growth in the People’s Republic rose 4.8% year-on-year in August, and is broadly back at a pre-crisis trend. Excluding China, emerging market retail sales and industrial production are still down by minus-3.5% and minus-5.5% in year-on-year terms. The contrast will likely be sharpened when China’s so-called Golden Week holiday, typically a shopping bonanza, kicks off next week. (By Una Galani)",

  "text": "MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - In 2006, Breakingviews criticised General Electric for its sprawl. We argued that “spinning off NBC to shareholders would make GE a more focused industrial company”, bring in some $35 billion of cash and aid Chief Executive Jeff Immelt’s desire to bolster the group’s finances. The only reason GE kept the media business was because its executives liked to hobnob with celebrities, we wrote.\n\nGeneral Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt listens during a news conference to discuss the company's plan to move its headquarters to the city of Boston in Boston, Massachusetts, April 4, 2016.\n\nAll of that was true. And the case for raising cash and refocusing is hard to refute now that the company is worth 80% less than it was at the time. But GE’s public relations machine went on the warpath. In particular, it argued for a correction to a line that NBC “is rarely among the best performers”. The Wall Street Journal, which had syndicated the column, agreed. Breakingviews held its ground.\n\nAt the time, GE’s tactics came across as disproportionately aggressive. Why was America’s most-admired industrial company taking such offence at a piece that took as its premise the “remarkable job” it had done “managing its eclectic collection of assets” and beating rivals in the market? “Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric” clears up the confusion. GE’s corporate culture was obsessed with storytelling. Anything that swerved from its chosen narrative, even if true, was anathema.\n\nGE’s downfall has been startling. The company, whose origin myth lies with the inventor Thomas Edison but owes more to financier John Pierpont Morgan, has seen its market value drop from $600 billion at the start of the century to $53 billion today. It has been cast from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it was once the sole name to have endured for the benchmark’s first 100 years. The company’s credit rating has been slashed. Any reasonable prediction for its future is not as a vast industrial juggernaut but as the manufacturer of jet engines, and perhaps of healthcare equipment.\n\nAll this bad news has been obvious in the marketplace. But Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann, reporters at the Wall Street Journal, provide texture below the surface. They reveal what happens when executives, for want of a better expression, drink too much of their own Kool-Aid. GE bosses from Immelt on down believed they, and the company they worked for, were infallible. Mistaking a story for a strategy is how companies die.\n\n“Under Immelt, the company believed that the will to hit a target could supersede the math, even when hundreds of thousands of livelihoods – those of investors, customers, and suppliers, to say nothing of workers retirees, and their families – hung in the balance,” the authors summarise. “GE became synonymous with the idea that all that stood between a company and an arbitrary $2 earnings (per share) target was drive – simply wanting it bad enough.”\n\n“Lights Out” shows how Immelt, a hard-charging former Dartmouth football player, rode roughshod over opposition from within, including from the board of directors he ruled with an iron fist. One telling anecdote reveals how Sandy Warner, a long-serving director and former chairman of JPMorgan, was effectively cast from the board for his insistence in 2016 that Immelt accelerates his succession plans.\n\nHoping to exorcise the demons of GE’s near-death experience during the financial crisis of 2008, Immelt and his lieutenants – including the man who would succeed him, John Flannery – were hell-bent on finding a big, transformational deal. The one they settled on, a purchase of Alstom’s power assets, turned out to be an utter disaster. “Lights Out” shows that outcome was clear even before the near-$14 billion purchase had closed. Yet Immelt’s supplicants refused to back out because there was no crossing the big boss’s desire to tell the story that GE was back in the business of getting bigger.\n\nThe overarching need to tell tales, at all costs, proved Immelt’s undoing. His reliance on Beth Comstock, the chief marketing officer, and her belief that the company needed merely to “pick a simple story…and tell it again, and again, and again,” helped lead the executive team to ignore facts and figures that got in the way. It also spawned stupid slogans like “Imagination at Work”, which Immelt once declared was “a reason for being”. And it spawned a doomed effort to cast itself as America’s oldest startup, with billions of dollars frittered away on its “Predix” software and data analytics project.\n\nIn the end, Immelt was gently shown the door and Flannery took his place, only to discover the truth behind the marketing mumbo jumbo. The company was largely meeting its numbers through legal, but stupid, financial chicanery that was starving the business of cash. He also found that GE’s decision to spin off its insurance assets more than a decade before had left the company on the hook for some $15 billion. And so on.\n\nAs a dyed-in-the-wool GE guy, Flannery proved the wrong executive to fix what he and other Immelt acolytes had broken. He lasted just 14 months. But his decision to bring Larry Culp onto the board, and eventually make him the company’s lead independent director, proved prescient. The no-nonsense, numbers-obsessed Culp was previously CEO of rival conglomerate Danaher, which today is worth nearly three times as much as GE.\n\nWhen Culp took charge in 2018, he inherited a worse hand than Immelt received when replacing the legendary Jack Welch just before Sept. 11, 2001. But at least there is no longer any sense that Culp’s mission will be to restore the conglomerate to its Welch-and-Immelt-era swagger. That story is over.",

  "text": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe’s patchwork of middling banks is a major weak point for the bloc’s economy. Top regulator Andrea Enria, who chairs the European Central Bank’s supervisory board, is doing his bit to make cross-border mergers easier. But the creation of a lender with the heft to rival U.S. behemoths requires politicians to make it a priority.\n\nA man walks into the JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf in London May 11, 2012.\n\nSIZE ENVY\n\nThe euro zone’s five biggest banks by assets - BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Banco Santander, Société Générale and Deutsche Bank – have a combined market value of 110 billion euros and generated 22 billion euros of earnings in 2019. JPMorgan alone is worth twice as much, and produced 38% more net profit.\n\nThat lack of scale worries the continent’s bank executives, but should also concern finance ministers like Germany’s Olaf Scholz and France’s Bruno Le Maire. Operating costs at the five major European lenders will consume 66% of combined revenue this year, using median Refinitiv estimates, compared with just 58% for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.\n\nThe American giants also make expensive technology investments go further: JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon can spread the cost of developing, say, a new fixed-income trading system over a much greater number of transactions than his counterparts at Deutsche and BNP. The mismatch cements the Europeans’ status as technology laggards, eroding their market share. Of the income from equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities trading earned by the industry’s top 12 players in the 18 months to the end of June, Deutsche, BNP and SocGen together pocketed just 13.6%.\n\nSuch U.S. dominance breeds a risky reliance among European companies on American balance sheets. JPMorgan, Citi, BofA and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners on 25% of German syndicated loans in the first half of 2019, according to Refinitiv data. A year later that proportion had roughly halved, as the Americans retreated just when pandemic-hit firms most needed cash.\n\nART OF THE DEAL\n\nMega-mergers of the kind that created the $280 billion JPMorgan are one solution to Europe’s scale deficiencies. A union of Deutsche and BNP, for example, would have a bigger and more diversified balance sheet. Its technology investments in wholesale and retail banking would pack a greater punch.\n\nEnria and the ECB have recently tried to make dealmaking easier. In a July consultation paper, the supervisor said merging banks can use existing bespoke models when assessing the riskiness of different assets. This makes it easier for CEOs to predict how much capital the combined entity will need.\n\nThe regulator is also making a virtue of the fact that European bank shares consistently trade below book value. Buying a lender for less than the accounting value of its net assets creates a capital gain – known as badwill – which the acquirer can use to cover merger costs and clean up bad debt.\n\nNor will the ECB necessarily add extra capital charges after a deal. Indeed, supervisors even have the power to ignore cross-border exposures within the euro zone when calculating whether the combined bank should hold more capital under global rules for systemically important banks, known as G-SIBs. This could shield some combinations from a significantly higher buffer.\n\nThe ECB’s pro-M&A message helped grease the wheels for the 16 billion euro union of Spain’s Caixabank and Bankia, unveiled last Friday. But that relatively small-fry combination underscores that most European bank mergers have been domestic affairs.\n\nNET INTEREST\n\nThere’s only so much Enria can do about this. Cross-border deals tend to be light on cost savings like branch closures. French, German and Italian mortgages, for example, are covered by different consumer-protection regulations and bankruptcy laws.\n\nNational watchdogs also get in the way. In theory, a pan-European bank can move spare liquidity to the most attractive lending opportunities. Yet while that’s technically possible under Europe’s Capital Requirements Regulation, regulators in Germany and elsewhere have blocked it. They’re worried about local savers’ money ending up funding, say, Italian small-business loans.\n\nThe regulatory playing field is just as uneven when it comes to capital. ING and SocGen are both in the same risk category under G-SIB rankings. But the Dutch lender’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was almost 2 percentage points higher than its French counterpart’s at the end of 2019, mostly because of a charge for systemic riskiness imposed by the Dutch central bank.\n\nIroning out these discrepancies is currently above Enria’s pay grade. European governments are reluctant to cede more power to his single regulator, since national taxpayers could still be on the hook if a big bank fails.\n\nYet there are glimmers of hope. Last year Scholz broke a long-held taboo in Germany by calling for a common deposit insurance scheme. More recently, European governments agreed to issue common debt as part of the pandemic response. Both could be seen as tentative steps toward tighter banking integration. The pandemic has underscored the role that large, diversified lenders can play in keeping companies afloat during a cash crunch. If they’re serious about building a European JPMorgan, national regulators and politicians will have to lay the foundations.",

  "text": "FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: An exterior view of China Evergrande Centre in Hong Kong, China March 26, 2018. Picture taken March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo - RC2IVI9TSULX\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The time has come for China to confront a too-big-to-fail quandary. In a letter to local government officials, highly indebted property developer China Evergrande contends that if it doesn’t secure approval soon for its reverse merger plan, it will wreak widespread havoc. Although the company says the missive is fake, the questions in it regarding systemic risk are real for investors and Beijing.\n\nEvergrande beseeched officials in its home province of Guangdong for assistance with a so-called back-door listing, according to a copy of the Aug. 24 letter, whose authenticity was confirmed by Reuters sources. The idea, first proposed as part of an October 2016 restructuring, was for subsidiary Hengda to combine with a publicly traded state developer. If the deal doesn’t happen by January 2021, a group of investors can demand repayment of some 144 billion yuan, or about $21 billion, all of Evergrande’s cash as of June 30.\n\nThe letter suggests a private sense of concern that Evergrande rarely exhibits in public. Chairman Hui Ka Yan often provides a helping hand to Beijing, supporting national goals such as poverty alleviation, even as its own debt load has surpassed $100 billion. Evergrande shares tumbled by as much as 6% on the news. S&P Global cut its outlook on the credit rating to negative from stable. The Shanghai Stock Exchange temporarily suspended trading in two of the company’s bonds on Friday.\n\nThe lengthy delay obtaining approval could have to do with an unofficial rule from 1993 that restricts Chinese developers from being publicly traded on the mainland, in a bid to contain some of the country’s real estate exuberance. Either way, Beijing is in something of a bind.\n\nThe consequences laid out in the letter would hit dozens of lenders including Agricultural Bank of China, while potentially affecting 3 million jobs. It’s possible that the fallout is being exaggerated to put pressure on authorities to let Evergrande proceed with its plan. At the same time, the company has been taking multiple steps to raise cash. And Evergrande’s backers have a legitimate claim on a very large sum. All of that will combine to force a reckoning soon.",

  "text": "LONDON/NEW YORK/MILAN/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.\n\nThe sign outside the Olive Garden restaurant is seen in Westminster, Colorado in this March 19, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\nLATEST\n\n- Vaccine nervousness\n\n- Darden’s beat\n\n- Oil’s straight talking\n\nJAB JOB. Pharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are racing to make Covid-19 vaccines – but the real holdup may be Americans themselves. Less than 40% say they’re likely, or somewhat likely, to sign up for the first-generation vaccine, according to a recent Axios-Ipsos Coronavirus Index, with around a fifth saying they’d wait at least a year. They’re also balking at paying: A third say they plan to pay nothing out of pocket for the jab.\n\nThis is bad news for everyone, not just Big Pharma. Fully opening schools, offices, restaurants – indeed, the economy itself – relies, in large part, on people taking a vaccine. A viable jab could boost U.S. growth by a full 3%, according to Goldman Sachs. True, Americans’ minds may change if the vaccine becomes a reality, but this wait-and-see skepticism could prove deadly – and costly. (By Anna Szymanski)\n\nBETTER ON THE OTHER SIDE. Darden Restaurants, the owner of food chain Olive Garden, is giving investors comforting results. It reinstated its dividend on Thursday and beat earnings estimates for the quarter ended Aug. 30. Shares jumped 10%.\n\nIt’s not that the casual dining company run by Gene Lee hasn’t suffered the same plight as others during Covid-19 lockdowns. Sales of $1.5 billion reflected a 28% year-over-year drop. The good news is that they were up 20% compared to the previous quarter, suggesting cravings for the unlimited pasta bowls are coming back in full force.\n\nImportantly, the company pared down its expenses – EBITDA swung back into positive territory in the quarter. The pandemic may be presenting its fair share of challenges for restaurateurs. But for Olive Garden, it’s nothing a little chicken parm can’t solve. (By Amanda Gomez)\n\nBLACK GOLD IS RED. “What more could possibly go wrong?” No truer words have been spoken in the oil patch than those in response to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which published its results on Wednesday. There hasn’t been much good news since Covid-19 torpedoed global economic growth, taking oil prices with it. Respondents took on both sides of the U.S. political spectrum, too. One blamed “poor management by the president and the Senate” while another said that an election win for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would “absolutely kill our industry”.\n\nEither way, the oil price outlook is not good. A majority said the price of West Texas Intermediate crude would be below $45 a barrel by the end of the year, not much higher than the price on Wednesday. That is below where new wells break even, on average, across the United States, according to a report the Dallas Fed published earlier this month. Maybe more could, in fact, go wrong. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)\n\nSMOOTH(ER) LANDING. Rishi Sunak is padding the brick wall of debt facing Britain’s small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The finance minister is extending to 10 years from six years the length of its Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which has disbursed 38 billion pounds. Under the old terms, an SME with the average 30,000 pound loan would face 6,800 pounds of annual payments starting next summer, according to Breakingviews estimates. That’s two-thirds of the median earnings a British SME generates in a year. Under the new terms, it’s 4,100 pounds – or two-fifths of median earnings.\n\nThat’s better, but still intimidating for an independent hotel or bar that might not generate meaningful cash flow at all this year. Sunak is also allowing firms who struggle with the new terms to suspend payments altogether for six months. That might be more popular than he suspects. (By Liam Proud)\n\nSUGAR HIGH. The lockdown boom in at-home exercise may have peaked. Echelon Fitness said this week that it was releasing a so-called Prime Bike on Amazon.com, costing less than a third of cycling giant Peloton Interactive’s original model. But Amazon has since disavowed any formal relationship with the product.\n\nCompanies have good reason to jump into the virtual fitness craze at full speed. Peloton’s share price is up over 230% this year, and other companies, like Zwift and Mirror, are posting lofty valuations, despite the total addressable market being smaller than they collectively claim. It isn’t the only industry riding the financial markets boom either. From electric vehicles to online gaming, companies are hitting up over-jazzercized investors.\n\nThese stories are big red flags. Buzzwords and loose relationships can boost company valuations when markets are frothy. They’re not just warnings that the individual company might have problems – but that the entire industry could be riding an artificial rush. (By Anna Szymanski)\n\nBOND OR BUST. Cinemas are in a fight for survival. With a second wave of Covid-19 unfolding and studios delaying blockbusters, movie theatres are struggling to lure viewers. That’s an acute problem for debt-laden Cineworld, which on Thursday warned its future depends on relief from creditors. Chief Executive Mooky Greidinger needs to get debt below 9 times EBITDA by the end of the year. But net borrowing, excluding leases, was $4 billion at the end of June, while first-half EBITDA was just $53 million. The UK company’s shares fell 12% by midday on Thursday.\n\nAlthough more than 70% of Cineworld’s theatres have reopened since June, audiences and movies have not returned. Potential crowd-pleasers like Marvel’s “Black Widow” have been delayed to next year, while Walt Disney released “Mulan” online. The next James Bond movie, “No Time to Die”, arrives in November. Bringing crowds back to cinemas may be 007’s toughest mission yet. (By Karen Kwok)\n\nHARD TO GET. UniCredit is becoming Italy’s most desirable bank M&A partner. The 15 billion euro lender run by Jean Pierre Mustier is reluctant to participate in the consolidation of the country’s fragmented financial sector. Yet potential partners keep lining up. UniCredit may pursue a tie-up with smaller rival Banco BPM, Italian financial daily MF said on Thursday. That would be an alternative to a potential rescue of state-owned lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena.\n\nBPM has good reason to seek a union. After Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase of UBI Banca, another merger between two rivals could leave the 2 billion euro lender to fend for itself in a more competitive market. But UniCredit also has an interest in playing the field. Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri is desperate to offload Monte Paschi and UniCredit is his best hope. By showing he has alternatives, Mustier has a better chance of persuading Gualtieri to give Monte Paschi away for free. (By Lisa Jucca)\n\nWORK FROM HOME. WeWork may be riding out the pandemic by staying closer to home. The troubled U.S. office-sharing outfit will sell control of its Chinese business to existing investor and Shanghai-based private equity firm Trustbridge Partners. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but WeWork concurrently announced that the China unit received $200 million in funds from existing investors.\n\nWeWork could certainly use the help. Even before Covid-19 struck, China’s fiercely competitive commercial property market suffered from an inventory glut. Vacancy rates in 18 major cities tracked by CBRE climbed to 24% in the second quarter, from an already high 21% a year earlier. A slow economic recovery, which has hit the country’s technology startups particularly hard, will further weigh on demand. Still, it may not be all that bad for WeWork China’s new bosses. With China’s unpredictable lockdown rules and companies cutting budgets, businesses may find flexible and short-term office leasing more appealing. (By Yawen Chen)\n\nTHE CAT’S MEOW. Spending on dog food, cat litter and flea collars is proving resilient in the Covid-19 recession. Pets at Home said on Thursday it expects that underlying pre-tax profit for the year to March 2021 will be ahead of current expectations of 73 million pounds. The upbeat statement cancelled out fears about another lockdown hitting the British company’s 453 retail stores. Its shares soared 17% on Thursday morning.\n\nThe 1.8 billion pound company’s bottom line is still down on the most recent financial year, when underlying pre-tax profit was 100 million pounds. Nevertheless, pet owners’ generosity is good news for big consumer groups, including Nestlé. The Swiss owner of Purina PetCare has been expanding its offerings for domestic animals. Chief Executive Mark Schneider will doubtless be relieved that owners are willing to keep spending on their furry friends. (By Dasha Afanasieva)",

  "text": "Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, pauses while playing bridge as part of the company annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska U.S. May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Buffett effect is mounting a comeback. The Sage of Omaha’s Berkshire Hathaway is helping local U.S. TV network operator E.W. Scripps finance its $2.7 billion takeover of a rival. As soon as the deal was unveiled on Thursday, Scripps stock soared as much as 40% before dropping back some. It’s a stark contrast to the drubbing Occidental Petroleum took after he enabled it to pounce on an oil competitor.\n\nScripps and its target, ION Media, are small by Berkshire standards: The tie-up will increase the buyer’s broadcast footprint to more than 100 TV stations in the United States once the deal is complete.\n\nWith a market value of just $853 million when stock markets closed on Wednesday, Scripps had to think creatively to scrape together enough money for its privately owned prize. It’s using cash of $300 million and is taking on $1.9 billion of debt. That’ll take Scripps’ net debt to a little over 5 times EBITDA. That’s high as it is; any more, especially during the current economic uncertainty, would have pushed the limits.\n\nEnter Warren Buffett. Berkshire is stumping up $600 million in preferred shares that pay an annual dividend of 8%. The terms for its help also prevent Scripps from issuing regular dividends or repurchasing shares as long as the preferred stock exists. Scripps can buy them back after five years.\n\nThe stretch looks like it will pay off for Scripps. Adding ION’s stations will more than double Scripps’ EBITDA – this year analysts are forecasting more than $300 million – and the cost savings are substantial. Assume ION’s earnings before interest and taxes are around $300 million. Add the $120 million in estimated synergies and tax the sum, and Scripps looks set for a 12% return on investment – not bad for a business that lost money last year.\n\nBuffett’s oft-heralded halo effect appears to have paid off this time. His involvement with Occidental, though, using a similar structure was a flop. The shares tanked on the day Chief Executive Vicki Hollub announced its hostile offer for Anadarko Petroleum almost 18 months ago, and never recovered. His return to media deals, a sector he knows well, can be his path to atoning for his Oxy sins.",

A intenção é que, a partir disso, seja criado um novo e amplo tributo sobre transações financeiras, nos moldes da extinta CPMF, conforme sinalizou Guedes na semana passada.

Com o avanço de agosto, o saldo de financiamentos no país passou a responder por 51,9% do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), maior patamar desde maio de 2016 (51,97%).\n\nNos oito primeiros meses do ano, a expansão do crédito foi de 7,4% e, em doze meses, de 12,1%.\n\nPara 2020, o BC revisou para cima sua projeção de crescimento do crédito a 11,5%, de 7,6% antes, principalmente pela demanda acentuada de crédito das empresas em meio à pandemia de coronavírus, atendida tanto pela expansão do crédito livre como pelo crédito direcionado.\n\nEm agosto, o crédito às pessoas jurídicas teve uma alta mais forte, de 2,4% sobre julho, ao passo que o crédito às famílias cresceu 1,5% na mesma base de comparação. Em doze meses, esses avanços foram de 16,7% e 8,8%, respectivamente.\n\nA inadimplência em recursos livres, em que as taxas são definidas livremente pelas instituições financeiras, renovou sua mínima da série histórica iniciada em março de 2011 a 3,3%, ante 3,5% em julho.\n\nO movimento tem ocorrido em meio à forte recomposição de renda proporcionada pelo programa de auxílio emergencial, que de abril a agosto concedeu benefício de 600 reais a informais e vulneráveis. Para o período de setembro a dezembro, o valor mensal será de 300 reais. No total, a perspectiva do governo é gastar 321,8 bilhões de reais com a iniciativa.\n\nO BC também apontou, já no mês passado, que há dois fatores contribuindo para a diminuição da inadimplência: renegociações e repactuações dos financiamentos e a possibilidade de postergação de parcelas, instituída por bancos.\n\nQuanto ao custo dos financiamentos no país, os juros médios caíram a 26,7% ao ano em agosto, contra 27,3% no mês anterior, também no segmento de recursos livres.\n\nO spread, que mede a diferença entre a taxa de captação dos bancos e a cobrada a seus clientes, foi a 22,3 pontos percentuais no segmento, ante 23,0 pontos em julho.",

O dólar futuro negociado na B3 caía 0,69%, a 5,5145 reais.\n\nDiversos analistas citaram a notícia de que as empresas industriais da China registraram crescimento do lucro pelo quarto mês seguido em agosto como um dos principais fatores para a recuperação de ativos de risco de todo o mundo nesta segunda-feira.\n\nOs futuros de Wall Street e as bolsas de valores europeias registravam ganhos depois da leitura positiva da China, enquanto o índice do dólar contra uma cesta de pares fortes caía 0,33%. Moedas arriscadas cujo movimento o real tende a acompanhar -- como rand sul-africano, peso mexicano e peso chileno -- operavam em alta.\n\nApesar do otimismo desta manhã, os agentes do mercado não descartavam a volatilidade para esta semana, que será marcada por importantes indicadores econômicos norte-americanos e contará com as eleições presidenciais dos Estados Unidos no sábado.\n\nCom um prazo apertado antes de os norte-americanos partirem para as urnas, democratas na Câmara dos Deputados dos EUA estão trabalhando em um pacote de estímulo de 2,2 trilhões de dólares para combate aos efeitos do coronavírus e que pode ser votado esta semana. O mercado de trabalho da maior economia do mundo tem mostrado sinais de desaceleração desde que um programa de apoio a desempregados venceu no final de julho.\n\n“A proximidade com as eleições presidenciais nos EUA e as incertezas trazidas por um possível mandato democrata continuam a pesar nas decisões de investimento”, disse em nota Jason Vieira, economista-chefe da Infinity Asset.\n\n“Localmente”, acrescentou, “a falta de avanços concretos na agenda de reformas do governo, com projetos em fase perigosamente embrionária mantém a elevada volatilidade, com especial choque nos mercados de renda fixa e no câmbio.”\n\nO presidente Jair Bolsonaro tem reunião marcada para as 11h desta segunda-feira com ministros e líderes para fechar detalhes da proposta da nova etapa da reforma tributária e do Renda Cidadã, programa substituto do Bolsa Família, e as medidas deverão ser encaminhadas na terça-feira ao Legislativo.\n\nA incerteza fiscal sobre como esse auxílio seria financiado sem desrespeito ao teto de gastos tem sido uma das principais preocupações dos investidores locais nas últimas semanas, somando-se a um cenário de juros baixos, crescimento econômico fraco e tensões políticas em Brasília.\n\nNo ano de 2020, a moeda norte-americana acumula salto de cerca de 38% contra o real.\n\nNa última sessão, na sexta-feira, o dólar à vista registrou alta de 0,74%, a 5,5538 reais na venda.\n\nO Banco Central disse na última sexta-feira que iniciará na quarta-feira, dia 30, a rolagem de 130.890 contratos de swap cambial com vencimento em 3 de novembro de 2020, num total de 6,5 bilhões de dólares.",

Os democratas aproveitaram rapidamente a reportagem para pintar Trump como um sonegador de impostos e questionar sua imagem cuidadosamente cultivada de empresário habilidoso.\n\nO líder democrata no Senado, Chuck Schumer, usou o Twitter para pedir aos norte-americanos para levantarem a mão se pagam mais imposto de renda do que Trump.\n\nClassificando a reportagem de “fake news total” durante uma coletiva de imprensa na Casa Branca, Trump voltou a citar uma auditoria em andamento como motivo para não divulgar suas declarações de imposto. Em um comunicado enviado ao NYT, Alan Garten, um advogado da Organização Trump, disse que Trump pagou milhões de dólares de impostos pessoais ao longo da última década, sem discorrer sobre a descoberta especifica dos impostos de renda mínimos.\n\nA recusa contínua de Trump de divulgar suas declarações de imposto foi um ruptura de uma prática costumeira de candidatos presidenciais. Atualmente, ele trava uma batalha legal com procuradores da cidade de Nova York e com congressistas democratas que tentam obter estas declarações.\n\nEle também já havia indicado que prefere minimizar seu pagamento de impostos, dizendo em um debate presidencial de 2016 que isso o torna “esperto”.\n\nO NYT noticiou que Trump conseguiu minimizar seu pagamento de impostos relatando grandes perdas de seu império empresarial e disse que ele alegou 47,4 milhões de dólares de prejuízo em 2018, apesar de ter dito que tinha uma renda de ao menos 434,9 milhões de dólares em uma declaração financeira do mesmo ano.\n\nO jornal enfatizou que os documentos revelam somente o que Trump contou ao governo sobre seus negócios e que não indicaram sua verdadeira fortuna.",

No domingo, em meio a um desses encontros, Barros disse em sua conta no Twitter que houve avanço no texto que iria ser apresentado a Bolsonaro e aos líderes da Câmara e do Senado para sugestões.\n\n“Excelente reunião. Estamos trabalhando para garantir renda para mais de 20 milhões de famílias”, respondeu Bittar, também no Twitter, à postagem do líder governista.\n\nUma das ideias é incluir a Renda Cidadã, que vai substituir ao Bolsa Família, dentro da PEC do Pacto Federativo.\n\nNa proposta da reforma tributária, o governo está avaliando a amplitude da desoneração da folha de pagamento das empresas, mas isso depende do aval que o presidente dará para o modelo. A intenção é que, a partir disso, seja criado um novo e amplo tributo sobre transações financeiras, nos moldes da extinta CPMF, conforme sinalizou Guedes na semana passada. [nL2N2GK2H9]\n\nA prioridade é zerar a tributação sobre a folha para salários mais baixos, em especial para o salário mínimo, para incentivar a geração de empregos no pós-coronavírus.\n\nNo pacote da reforma tributária, o ministro da Economia disse que a intenção é criar um imposto digital.\n\nContudo, a própria assessora especial do ministro da Economia, Vanessa Canado, reconheceu no último mês que o imposto que está sendo estudado nos moldes da CPMF não tributa só operações digitais, mas todas as transações da economia, justamente para que tenha essa característica de base ampla.",

Com o avanço de agosto, o saldo de financiamentos no país passou a responder por 51,9% do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), maior patamar desde maio de 2016 (51,97%).\n\nNos oito primeiros meses do ano, a expansão do crédito foi de 7,4% e, em doze meses, de 12,1%.\n\nPara 2020, o BC revisou para cima sua projeção de crescimento do crédito a 11,5%, de 7,6% antes, principalmente pela demanda acentuada de crédito das empresas em meio à pandemia de coronavírus, atendida tanto pela expansão do crédito livre como pelo crédito direcionado.\n\nEm agosto, o crédito às pessoas jurídicas teve uma alta mais forte, de 2,4% sobre julho, ao passo que o crédito às famílias cresceu 1,5% na mesma base de comparação. Em doze meses, esses avanços foram de 16,7% e 8,8%, respectivamente.\n\nA inadimplência em recursos livres, em que as taxas são definidas livremente pelas instituições financeiras, renovou sua mínima da série histórica iniciada em março de 2011 a 3,3%, ante 3,5% em julho.\n\nO movimento tem ocorrido em meio à forte recomposição de renda proporcionada pelo programa de auxílio emergencial, que de abril a agosto concedeu benefício de 600 reais a informais e vulneráveis. Para o período de setembro a dezembro, o valor mensal será de 300 reais. No total, a perspectiva do governo é gastar 321,8 bilhões de reais com a iniciativa.\n\nO BC também apontou, já no mês passado, que há dois fatores contribuindo para a diminuição da inadimplência: renegociações e repactuações dos financiamentos e a possibilidade de postergação de parcelas, instituída por bancos.\n\nQuanto ao custo dos financiamentos no país, os juros médios caíram a 26,7% ao ano em agosto, contra 27,3% no mês anterior, também no segmento de recursos livres.\n\nO spread, que mede a diferença entre a taxa de captação dos bancos e a cobrada a seus clientes, foi a 22,3 pontos percentuais no segmento, ante 23,0 pontos em julho.",

REUTERS/Bryn Lennon\n\nHamilton, que havia largado na pole position em Sochi buscando sua 91ª vitória para igualar o recorde da lenda da Ferrari, Michael Schumacher, terminou em terceiro, atrás de Max Verstappen, da Red Bull.\n\nEle acusou os fiscais de tentarem impedi-lo de vencer e disse que as sanções “ridículas” foram excessivas, mas esperadas: “Estão tentando me parar, não estão?”, disse o britânico à emissora Sky Sports.\n\nA vantagem do britânico para Bottas diminuiu para ainda confortáveis 44 pontos transcorridas 10 das 17 corridas, depois que o finlandês somou um ponto extra por ter feito a volta mais rápida.\n\n“Nunca desista. É um bom dia”, disse Bottas, que respondeu aos críticos por meio de falas pelo rádio da equipe enquanto recebia a bandeirada.\n\n“É bom vencer, fazia tempo e eu preciso tentar manter o embalo… ainda há algumas corridas pela frente, então nunca se sabe. Vou continuar tentando. Não desistirei e veremos como termina”.\n\nA vitória - por 7,729 segundos - foi a segunda do finlandês nesta temporada e a primeira desde o retorno da F1 com o GP da Áustria, em julho.\n\nPUNIÇÔES MARCARAM\n\nBottas disse que teve sorte, mas que provavelmente teria vencido de qualquer maneira, com Hamilton largando com pneus macios, que desgastam mais, enquanto o finlandês estava com pneus médios, uma melhor estratégia para o longo prazo.\n\nAs esperanças de Hamilton, de qualquer maneira, desapareceram quando os fiscais emitiram duas punições de cinco segundos por largadas fora da área designada enquanto ele se dirigia para o grid.\n\nHamilton também somou dois pontos de punição na sua habilitação, ficando a apenas dois de ser suspenso por uma corrida -- o que acontece quando um piloto soma 12 pontos ao longo de 12 meses.\n\nEm uma corrida maçante e solitária para os três primeiros, após duas etapas empolgantes na Itália, a Mercedes manteve sua marca de vencer todos os Grandes Prêmios da Rússia desde o primeiro, em 2014, no circuito urbano ao redor das instalações das Olimpíadas de Inverno.\n\nO mexicano Sergio Pérez foi quarto colocado pela Racing Point, com o australiano Daniel Ricciardo em quinto, pela Renault, e Charles Leclerc, em sexto, pela Ferrari.\n\nO francês Esteban Ocon ficou em sétimo, pela Renault, com o russo Daniil Kvyat em oitavo, o que agradou o primeiro público de verdade da temporada, após oito corridas com portões fechados devido à pandemia de Covid-19.\n\nSeu companheiro de AlphaTauri, Pierre Gasly, que surpreendeu ao vencer em Monza, foi nono colocado, enquanto Alexander Albon, da Red Bull, levou o último ponto, na décima posição.\n\n(Reportagem de Alan Baldwin em Londres)",

No domingo, em meio a um desses encontros, Barros disse em sua conta no Twitter que houve avanço no texto que iria ser apresentado a Bolsonaro e aos líderes da Câmara e do Senado para sugestões.\n\n“Excelente reunião. Estamos trabalhando para garantir renda para mais de 20 milhões de famílias”, respondeu Bittar, também no Twitter, à postagem do líder governista.\n\nUma das ideias é incluir a Renda Cidadã, que vai substituir ao Bolsa Família, dentro da PEC do Pacto Federativo.\n\nNa proposta da reforma tributária, o governo está avaliando a amplitude da desoneração da folha de pagamento das empresas, mas isso depende do aval que o presidente dará para o modelo. A intenção é que, a partir disso, seja criado um novo e amplo tributo sobre transações financeiras, nos moldes da extinta CPMF, conforme sinalizou Guedes na semana passada. [nL2N2GK2H9]\n\nA prioridade é zerar a tributação sobre a folha para salários mais baixos, em especial para o salário mínimo, para incentivar a geração de empregos no pós-coronavírus.\n\nNo pacote da reforma tributária, o ministro da Economia disse que a intenção é criar um imposto digital.\n\nContudo, a própria assessora especial do ministro da Economia, Vanessa Canado, reconheceu no último mês que o imposto que está sendo estudado nos moldes da CPMF não tributa só operações digitais, mas todas as transações da economia, justamente para que tenha essa característica de base ampla.",

And those clauses will remain in that bill.”\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said in London that Britain’s focus was on progress in trade talks.\n\n“Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,” he said.\n\n“We simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.”\n\nTrade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy links and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far.\n\nEU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more talks before their next summit on Oct. 15-16. They will then assess whether to try push a deal over the line or prepare for the most damaging Brexit at the end of the year.\n\nThe EU says negotiators must seal an agreement by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments in the EU so that it can take effect from 2021 when Britain’s standstill transition ends after Brexit.\n\nOtherwise, the delicate peace on the island of Ireland as well as an estimated trillion euros worth of annual EU-UK trade would be at risk as the sides would fall back on general World Trade Organization rules that include tariffs and quotas.",

Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

  "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Washington has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo faces the news media with Iraq's Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein at the State Department in Washington, U.S., August 19, 2020. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nAny move by the United States to scale down its diplomatic presence in a country where it has up to 5,000 troops would be widely seen in the region as an escalation of its confrontation with Iran, which Washington blames for missile and bomb attacks.\n\nThat in turn would open the possibility of military action, with just weeks to go before an election in which President Donald Trump has campaigned on a hard line towards Tehran and its proxies.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened to close the embassy in a phone call a week ago to President Barham Salih, two Iraqi government sources said. The conversation was initially reported by an Iraqi news website.\n\nBy Sunday, Washington had begun preparations to withdraw diplomatic staff if such a decision is taken, those sources and the two Western diplomats said.\n\nThe concern among the Iraqis is that pulling out diplomats would be followed quickly by military action against forces Washington blamed for attacks.\n\nPopulist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, issued a statement last week pleading for groups to avoid an escalation that would turn Iraq into a battleground.\n\nOne of the Western diplomats said the U.S. administration did not “want to be limited in their options” to weaken Iran or pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. Asked whether he expected Washington to respond with economic or military measures, the diplomat replied: “Strikes.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department, asked about plans to withdraw from Iraq, said: “We never comment on the Secretary’s private diplomatic conversations with foreign leaders ... Iran-backed groups launching rockets at our Embassy are a danger not only to us but to the Government of Iraq.”\n\nPERENNIAL RISK\n\nIn a region polarised between allies of Iran and the United States, Iraq is the rare exception: a country that has close ties with both. But that has left it open to a perennial risk of becoming a battle ground in a proxy war.\n\nThat risk was hammered home in January this year, when Washington killed Iran’s most important military commander, Qassem Soleimani, with a drone strike at Baghdad airport. Iran responded with missiles fired at U.S. bases in Iraq.\n\nSince then, a new prime minister has taken power in Iraq, supported by the United States, while Tehran still maintains close links to powerful Shi’ite armed movements.\n\nRockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic compound, constructed to be the biggest U.S. embassy in the world in central Baghdad’s so-called Green Zone during the U.S. occupation after a 2003 invasion.\n\nIn recent weeks rocket attacks near the embassy have increased and roadside bombs targeted convoys carrying equipment to the U.S.-led military coalition. One roadside attack hit a British convoy in Baghdad, the first of its kind against Western diplomats in Iraq for years.\n\nTwo Iraqi intelligence sources suggested plans to withdraw American diplomats were not yet in motion, and would depend on whether Iraqi security forces were able to do a better job of halting attacks. They said they had received orders to prevent attacks on U.S. sites, and had been told that U.S. evacuations would begin only if that effort failed.\n\nDOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\n\nIraqis are concerned about the impact of November’s presidential election on the Trump administration’s decision-making.\n\nWhile Trump has boasted of his hard line against Iran, he has also long promised to withdraw U.S. troops from engagements in the Middle East. The United States is already drawing down its force sent to help defeat Islamic State fighters in Iraq from 2014-2017.\n\nSome Iraqi officials dismissed Pompeo’s threat to pull out diplomats as bluster, designed to scare armed groups into stopping attacks. But they said it could backfire by provoking the militias instead, if they sense an opportunity to push Washington to retreat.\n\n“The American threat to close their embassy is merely a pressure tactic, but is a double-edged sword,” said Gati Rikabi, a member of Iraq’s parliamentary security committee.\n\nHe and another committee member said U.S. moves were designed to scare Iraqi leaders into supporting Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who has tried to check the power of Iran-aligned militia groups, with scant success.\n\nHAWKS ON BOTH SIDES\n\nThe militias are under public pressure to rein in supporters who might provoke Washington. Since last year, public opinion in Iraq has turned sharply against political groups seen as fomenting violence on behalf of Iran.\n\nPublicly, the powerful Iran-backed Shi’ite militia groups which control large factions in parliament have tried to distance themselves from attacks on Western targets.\n\nU.S. officials say they think the Shi’ite militias or their Iranian backers have created splinter offshoots to carry out such attacks, allowing the main organisations to evade blame.\n\nA senior figure in a Shi’ite Muslim political party said he thought Trump might want to pull out diplomats to keep them out of harm’s way and avoid an embarrassing pre-election incident.\n\nMilitia attacks were not necessarily under Tehran’s control, he said, noting that Iran’s foreign ministry had publicly called for a halt to attacks on diplomatic missions in Iraq.\n\n“Iran wants to boot the Americans out, but not at any cost. It doesn’t want instability on its Western border,” the Shi’ite leader said. “Just like there are hawks in the U.S., there are hawks in Iran who have contact with the groups carrying out attacks, who aren’t necessarily following state policy.”",

I have repeated the EU’s request to withdraw the contentious part of the draft Internal Markets Bill by the end of September,” Sefcovic told a news conference.\n\n“We maintain that the bill, if adopted in its current form, would constitute an extremely serious violation of ... the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law,” he said, urging speedy progress before he meets Gove again in mid-October.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said in London that Britain’s focus is on trying to make progress in formal trade talks with the EU.\n\n“As we are entering the final stages of the negotiations our focus is on what it will take to get a trade agreement in place, although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,” he said.\n\n“From the start of this process we’ve been saying that we simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.”\n\nTrade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy cooperation and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far.\n\nEU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more negotiations before their next summit on Oct. 15-16.\n\nThey will then assess whether to focus on pushing for a deal or preparing for a hard Brexit at the end of the year.\n\nThe EU says negotiators must seal a deal by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments so a deal can take effect from 2021 when Britain’s post-Brexit transition ends.",

Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.\n\n($1 = 0.8589 euros)",

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nThe Franco-Dutch group, sustained by 10.4 billion euros (9.5 billion pounds) in state-backed loans, faces higher duties in both home markets as well as EU plans to hike airlines’ carbon costs.\n\nThe struggle unfolding around Air France-KLM is part of a larger reckoning for carbon-intensive industries as efforts to tackle global warming spawn more taxes and regulation.\n\nWhile campaigners say those are long overdue, crisis-hit airlines warn their timing and severity will cost thousands more jobs and hurt development of lower-carbon technologies.\n\nNew taxes “do not support emissions reductions”, said Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith in response to proposed increases to French passenger duties.\n\n“In fact it’s counterproductive and would deprive us of finances that could otherwise be invested in environmental projects,” he told an online industry forum this month.\n\nTensions can only rise as emissions goals are toughened to slow dangerous climate change. The European Union’s executive now wants to cut greenhouse gas output by 55% in the next decade rather than the previous 40%, from a 1990 baseline.\n\nWhile the pandemic has dampened climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, their political legacy must be squared with the economic emergency.\n\nGREEN WAVE\n\nFrench municipal elections saw the ecologist EELV party take Lyon, Bordeaux and Strasbourg in a June 28 “Green Wave”. The next day, President Emmanuel Macron promised to advance 146 proposals from a “citizens’ climate convention”.\n\nThose include an airline duty increase to 30 euros per short-haul economy passenger and 400 euros for long-haul business, from their current 1.50-18 euro range. At 2019 traffic, officials say the sector would pay 4.2 billion euros.\n\nKey members of the government, which underwrote 7 billion euros for Air France, are backing away from the pledge as officials draft legislation in response to the convention.\n\n“It would be grotesque to take back with one hand what we’d given the sector with the other,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told daily Les Echos.\n\nLe Maire and his Dutch counterpart were among nine EU finance ministers who had called for “taxation or similar policies” to curb emissions by raising air fares.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, the Netherlands is introducing passenger duties worth 220 million euros at pre-crisis traffic. A Greenpeace legal challenge is also demanding steeper emissions cuts in return for KLM’s 3.4 billion-euro aid package.\n\nOFFSETS UPSET\n\nAirline emissions account for 2.5% of the global total but are set to triple by 2050. Under a U.N.-brokered programme, CORSIA, the industry aims to counter emissions growth from international flights with carbon offsets, whose effects are contested.\n\nAirbus AIR.PA has given itself until 2035 to put a \"zero-emission\" plane into service, but many are sceptical about that deadline. Synthetic fuels are also too scarce and expensive to offer a near-term solution.\n\nFor intra-European flights, airlines would face a higher bill for European carbon credits under plans outlined this month to reduce free permits for the sector.\n\nEU officials have also signalled likely moves to end a tax exemption for jet fuel enshrined in international treaties, a process that could take several years.\n\nGermany, which has pushed ahead with an airline tax increase to fund cheaper rail travel, plans binding minimum quotas for carbon-neutral alternative jet fuel.\n\nFar from giving struggling airlines a break, campaign groups are urging governments to use bailouts to force faster progress.\n\n“Airlines’ reliance on governments strengthens the case for acting to cut their emissions,” said Andrew Murphy of Brussels-based Transport & Environment.\n\nAssuming a slow recovery, the group says CORSIA’s market mechanism would price emissions as low as 17 cents per long-haul flight, leaving little incentive to curb greenhouse gases. ICAO, the U.N. aviation agency that developed the programme, said in a tweet it had been “misrepresented” by Transport & Environment.\n\nNOT FARE\n\nOther emissions-cutting proposals may divide the industry.\n\nAir France-KLM’s Smith called on French ministers to consider a minimum fare instead of taxes, citing the 40-euro minimum recently introduced in Austria. “Let’s discuss that,” he said in a newspaper interview.\n\nWhile minimum fares can curb overall traffic and emissions without hurting traditional airlines’ profits or jobs, they punish budget carriers and their customers.\n\n\"This is another mad idea from a high-fare airline that can only survive with over 10 billion euros of illegal state subsidies,\" Ryanair RYA.I said. The low-cost giant is challenging rivals' EU-approved bailouts in court.\n\n“Ordinary consumers all over Europe have benefited from and will continue to demand low fares, choice and competition,” it said.\n\nHowever these tensions play out, airlines face a rising tide of carbon costs on top of their current woes.\n\nMaintaining fuel tax exemptions would present a “flagrant inconsistency” with EU climate goals, said Christian Egenhofer of Brussels-based think tank CEPS.\n\nTaxing fuel would be an important step even if rates started low, Egenhofer said. “You know what happens with taxes – they always go up.”",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “catastrophic” biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nWith the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.\n\n“We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.”\n\nWithout action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.\n\nScientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge.\n\nWhile Monday’s pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.\n\n“We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,” Canada’s Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.\n\nACTION PLEDGE\n\nIn England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.\n\nHowever, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: “It’s great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there’s no funding.”\n\nThe EU’s executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.\n\nBut so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.\n\nSeparately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.\n\nThe pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases.",

The daily death toll was 1,039, bringing the total number of victims to 95,542, the ministry said.\n\nWhile daily cases are down slightly from a peak hit earlier this month, the federal government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indians to remain on guard, with the country’s often-fragile healthcare system struggling to handle the rising number of cases.\n\n“We are far from having achieved any kind of herd immunity, which necessitates that all of us should continue following COVID-appropriate behaviour,” India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told his social media followers in a broadcast on Sunday.",

We are well ahead of schedule,” Andrews told a daily news conference, anticipating a move to “COVID normal”, with most curbs eased.\n\nUK eyes tougher restrictions\n\nThe British government is mulling tougher restrictions in England to tackle a swiftly accelerating second wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, possibly outlawing more inter-household socialising.\n\n“We don’t want to bring on new restrictions but of course we keep a constant eye on what is going on with the COVID rate,” Junior Health Minister Helen Whately told Sky News. “We were looking at what we might be able to do.”\n\n“This is the moment when we have an opportunity - we have a choice for the country - to get this back under control,” Whately said. “We have to break these chains of transmission.”",

  "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain may be heading for a no-deal Brexit in three months, but among traders in London the feeling so far is one of deja vu rather than a panicky rush to dump UK assets.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pound coins are placed on broken glass and British flag in this illustration picture taken January 31, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nAfter Britain threatened to ditch parts of its European Union divorce deal this month, markets are pricing in a 40%-45% chance of exiting the EU trading bloc without any alternative arrangements at the end of 2020. Some banks see it higher.\n\nYet as the four-year political crisis between London and Brussels enters what may be its final stretch, investors and companies are not stampeding as heavily to sell sterling or hedge against volatility as they did when no-deal Brexit risks intensified in the past.\n\n“Brexit fatigue is definitely there. Coronavirus has overwhelmed Brexit. Participation levels are still relatively light and it’s generally opportunistic,” said Ian Tew, a sterling trader at Barclays in London.\n\nCash sterling weekly turnover rose 35% in the third week of September from late August, Refinitiv data shows -- but is below most weeks in September and October in 2019 and 2018, when worries about a no-deal Brexit intensified before deadlines to reach earlier agreements with the EU.\n\nTrue, sterling has fallen 5.8% this month from $1.3481 GBP=D3 on Sept. 1 to $1.27, reversing August's gains. But analysts say that move has been exaggerated by a general bout of risk aversion favouring the dollar rather than just Brexit fears.\n\nThe pound is well above last September’s low of $1.1959.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling's drop has been more measured, with the euro rising 2.8% to 91.50 pence EURGBP=D3 this month.\n\nDerivatives are pricing in more choppiness ahead, with implied volatility jumping to the highest level since the coronavirus panic of March and April GBP1MO=GBP3MO=. But it remains 15%-25% below late 2018 and 2019 highs.\n\nThat rise must be seen also in the context of higher market-wide volatility in 2020 .DBCVIX.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Three-month sterling/dollar implied volatility: )\n\nLESS GROUP THINK\n\nRichard Benson, head of portfolio investments at currency asset manager Millennium Global Investments, is short sterling and thinks trading activity is being dampened by more investors and traders working from home.\n\n“There’s slightly less group think. Less of the group endorsement of ‘Oh, we are all doing this, this is the trade’,” he said, adding that at a recent virtual industry roundtable the numbers of people short sterling were balanced by those long.\n\nAnother explanation, traders say, is that COVID-19 is overshadowing Brexit in the minds of investors and company executives.\n\nFor instance, exporters who would usually adjust currency hedges after a pound slump have seen those strategies upended by collapsing revenues. Coronavirus uncertainty could even force a change to the Dec. 31 deadline.\n\n“The market has become very jaded with the political process,” said Simon Manwaring, head of currencies trading at NatWest Markets, and “is looking for something more definitive” before clients hedge or take speculative positions.\n\nAaron Hurd, senior currency portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors, believes the two sides will reach a Brexit deal and wants to buy more pounds. But he is holding off as everyone tries to discern “how much of the political noise and the headline noise is posturing...And how much of it is real disagreement behind the scenes.”\n\nNERVES GROW\n\nStill, while activity levels suggest there is not the panic of previous years, nerves are beginning to jangle.\n\nDemand for put options - the right to sell sterling - has increased significantly, with three-month risk reversals GBP3MRR= at similar levels to late 2018 when London and Brussels struggled to clinch their withdrawal agreement.\n\nThat suggests investors are increasingly worried about further drops in the British currency.\n\nFor traders wanting protection from a falling pound, a price move probability of 11% is now priced into option contracts with a November and December expiry, up from 9.4% in early September, according to CME data.\n\nThe question is whether such nervousness translates into more aggressive selling.\n\n“Brexit was front and centre of everything in the past. Now it’s not,” said Barclays’ Tew, although it remained a “differentiating factor” that would keep the pound vulnerable.",

  "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects across markets, and investors are already trying to identify potential winners and losers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers a speech on the U.S. Supreme Court at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., September 27, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBroadly speaking, analysts say Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes could pressure company earnings. But they expect him to support infrastructure projects and renewable energy.\n\nA second Trump term, meanwhile, may bring more tax cuts and extend de-regulation that could benefit the energy and financial sectors, while risking continued tensions with China.\n\nWith the Senate majority also at stake, the election could allow one party to control the presidency and Congress, making it easier to enact legislation such as the additional fiscal stimulus currently being held up in a political standoff.\n\nHere is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:\n\nBIDEN BASKET\n\nALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A stronger expected “green energy” push under a Biden administration could support alternative energy stocks. For example, tax credit extensions would provide a boost for solar stocks such as Sunnova Energy International, SunPower Corp and Enphase Energy, according to Credit Suisse.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES: Tesla shares already have had a mammoth run during the Trump administration, but some believe a Biden presidency could further fuel the electric vehicle company’s shares.\n\n“Biden has proposed new tax incentives, government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs in particular,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in a report.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nOther potential winners from a Biden victory would be auto suppliers focused on electrification and green, emission-free technologies, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner and Visteon, Nelson wrote.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE: A large infrastructure spending package “may be an early priority for a Biden administration as it seeks a bipartisan win,” according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nBiden’s plan would boost a broad group of engineering and construction companies, with AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group and MasTec among the biggest beneficiaries, according to Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz.\n\nTARIFF TRADE: A Biden administration could see a calming of the U.S.-China tariff war. “Should trade policy be less-focused on the use of tariffs, both importers and exporters may benefit,” according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nJP Morgan in a July report listed Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher and 3M among a number of stocks that could outperform should a Biden presidency lead to a “de-escalation” in U.S.-China tariff tensions.\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nTAX RELIEF: A Biden loss could spell additional relief for companies that benefited from the president’s corporate tax cuts.\n\nIn its July report, JP Morgan listed AT&T, Target and Waste Management among companies that benefited from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could underperform in a Biden presidency.\n\nBANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration, particularly if a progressive such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a high-profile role.\n\nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say a Trump win with Republicans retaining the Senate is the best election scenario for banks, noting “the Republican agenda of reduced regulation remains intact.” Stocks to own in that scenario include Wells Fargo and Citigroup, KBW wrote.\n\nDEFENSE: Trump would probably “succeed in maintaining large defense spending, despite a Democratic House, given the reality of great power struggle with China and Russia,” BCA Research strategists said in a recent report.\n\nFOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES: “Support for energy companies and specifically fossil fuels appears to be an ongoing objective for Trump,” according to LPL’s Detrick. He added that most companies in this sector, excluding those in renewable energy, will likely benefit from a Trump victory.",

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nAn extraordinary year is shuffling into its final stretch and it’s packed with blockbuster events -- the race for a coronavirus cure or vaccine, a seismic U.S. presidential election and a possible no-deal Brexit that would end a 3-1/2 year long UK-Brussels standoff with a bang.\n\nSquaring the books after Q3 will be interesting too.\n\nMarkets have lost altitude lately but top tech stocks, while some 20% off peaks, are still up 65% year-to-date. Chinese shares have leapt 13%, while a dollar that spent recent months slumbering could suddenly be heading for its best month since 2016.\n\n(Graphic: Asset price performance since the coronavirus - )\n\n2/ STIMULUS AND VACCINES\n\nBy now we were meant to have resumed shopping, dining, travelling and commuting. Instead, regional lockdowns are returning, the global COVID-19 deathcount is marching toward a million and stocks are swooning.\n\nAll that has trained market focus on stimulus and vaccines. Governments from Canada and Britain to Thailand are stepping up on the former. The U.S. Congress is dithering over further relief but the possibility of mass evictions and defaults in an election year may persuade lawmakers to break the deadlock.\n\nAs for vaccines, several companies are conducting final-stage clinical trials; any signs of their efficacy would likely boost sentiment.\n\nThe COVID resurgence has ended talk of V- or U-shaped bouncebacks. Without more stimulus or vaccines, the trajectory could end up looking like a W or even an L.\n\n(Graphic: World stocks vs confirmed COVID-19 cases - )\n\n3/PAYROLLS FRIDAY\n\nSeptember U.S. jobs data, out on Friday, will be watched even more closely than usual over growing concern on lawmakers’ failure to agree on fresh fiscal stimulus to protect the economy. This will also be the final monthly gauge of the U.S. jobs market before Election Day on Nov. 3.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters expect payrolls rose 875,000, after growing by 1.371 million in August. Recent data, including weekly jobless claims, suggest a nascent economic recovery may be fading as the effects of the last fiscal stimulus wane.\n\nFed chief Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday told lawmakers that fresh fiscal stimulus could make the difference between a continued recovery and a much slower economic slog.\n\nBut a new deal before the presidential election looks unlikely, dimming the prospects for stock markets already hurt by election uncertainty and concern about the economy. A weak payrolls number could add to the angst.\n\n(Graphic: U.S. payrollls data - )\n\n4/ OH WOEFUL INFLATION\n\nPreliminary September euro zone inflation data is out Wednesday and, rest assured, the ECB will be watching closely.\n\nAugust inflation turned negative for the first time since May 2016. With the economy showing signs of weakening amid the coronavirus resurgence, concern is growing. ECB board member Fabio Panetta warned that inflation remains “uncomfortably” below its near-2% target.\n\nMarket-based inflation expectations, closely tracked by rate-setters, are also flashing warnings, having fallen to two-month lows. No wonder that speculation about another round of ECB stimulus before year-end is building, as are expectations for a rate cut in 2021.\n\n(Graphic: Inflation headache for the ECB - )\n\n5/ BANKING ON A DEAL?\n\nEuropean policymakers have stopped worrying that the region’s banks are too big to fail and instead fret they are too small to survive.\n\nAverage return on equity - a measure of profitability - at European banks is around 7%, half that of their American peers. The STOXX Europe 600 bank index .SX7P has fallen back below levels hit during the 2008 crisis and hovers off record lows.\n\nFor regulators, deals may be the only way out of the malaise. They are trying to make tie-ups easier -- helping drive mergers of domestic retail lenders in Italy and Spain this year.\n\nNow focus is on banking giants, with sources saying UBS examined a tie-up with Credit Suisse earlier this year. Deutsche Bank hinted this week it could join the fray once it finishes its latest overhaul.\n\nMuted share price reaction suggest investors have limited confidence mega deals can be pulled off just yet. But with losses caused by COVID-19 set to crystallise in the coming months, some may soon have no other option.\n\n(Graphic: European bank stocks vs the broader market -",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “catastrophic” biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nWith the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.\n\n“We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.”\n\nWithout action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.\n\nScientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge.\n\nWhile Monday’s pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.\n\n“We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,” Canada’s Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.\n\nACTION PLEDGE\n\nIn England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.\n\nHowever, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: “It’s great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there’s no funding.”\n\nThe EU’s executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.\n\nBut so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.\n\nSeparately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.\n\nThe pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases.",

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British naturalist David Attenborough has said he spent much of lockdown relishing the joy of the natural world by listening to the birds in his garden.\n\nAttenborough, the world’s most influential wildlife broadcaster, has become increasingly outspoken in recent years about the risks posed by climate change.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, the 94-year-old praised China for moving in the right direction on climate though he chided the United States.\n\n“The present administration in America, from a conservationist’s point of view, is disastrous. But there we are: that’s who’s been elected and we have to go through it,” he said.\n\nAttenborough, who launched last week a film about lessons learned during his seven decades as a television naturalist, said that the novel coronavirus lockdown had been relatively painless for him.\n\n“Many people are having a much worse time than I am,” he said. “I am lucky. I have a garden, I have a house... my daughter and I are surviving very well.”\n\n“I’ve certainly spent more time in my garden listening to birds, than I have for a very long time. A lot of people have been surprised by that - a lot of people have suddenly realised what deep, profound joy can come from witnessing the rest of the world - the natural world.”\n\nAhead of the release of his book and Netflix documentary - “A Life On Our Planet”, he called on people to not squander the natural world.\n\nAsked about activities of the Extinction Rebellion campaign group, he said that people should be careful not to break the law. Activists, he said, should treat the community with respect.",

  "text": "MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Any move from the Premier League to change the handball law for next season would need to be submitted to international law-making body IFAB next month in order to be considered.\n\nSoccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool v Leeds United - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - September 12, 2020 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah shoots at goal and is awarded a penalty for a handball.

Please contact your account representative for further details.\n\nIFAB holds its annual meeting, the forum where laws are passed and changed, in March but according to IFAB’s protocol football associations need to put in proposals by Nov. 1 in order to allow time for consultations across the game.\n\nA series of controversial handball decisions in the opening weeks of the Premier League has led to calls from some in the English game for the law to be changed.\n\nWhile the laws of the game are applied on an international scale, British football has a uniquely prominent role in the creation of the laws.\n\nThe decision-making General Assembly of IFAB is made up of the four British football associations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and four representatives of FIFA.\n\nAll decisions require a three-quarters majority, which in practice means FIFA’s representatives would need to agree to any British proposal.\n\nThe decision on what items are placed on the agenda is made at a November annual business meeting.\n\nCrystal Palace’s former England manager Roy Hodgson said he was “disillusioned” with the game after his side lost to a penalty awarded for a disputed handball.\n\n“I just don’t understand how we’ve allowed it to happen. The Premier League, the referee, the coaches, the managers, the players, I don’t know how we’ve allowed this type of situation, which we have at virtually every match at the moment, to occur because the rules of football are important,” he said.\n\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher, now a pundit with Sky Sports said: “Whether it’s the Premier League, the FA, FIFA, Pierluigi Collina (chairman of their referees’ committee), whoever’s involved in this — stop it, because you are ruining football for everybody”.\n\nThe law was introduced last season but the Premier League chose a different, more lenient interpretation, than many top European leagues.\n\nHowever, that changed this season with the league responding to calls from FIFA for all leagues to play by the same fundamental interpretations of all laws.\n\nThe number of handball penalties has increased across Europe and while there were complaints in Italy last season, the changes appear to have caused the strongest reaction in England.\n\nMuch of the controversy focuses on handballs by defenders where the referee rules their arm or hand is an “unnatural position” or is making the body bigger. The previous, established handball law relied primarily on referees making a judgment as to whether a handball was intentional or not.\n\nThere has been no indication from the Premier League or the Football Association that they intend to request a change to the law.\n\nThe Premier League did not immediately respond to a request for comment and IFAB declined to comment.\n\nOne option to deal with the concerns would be for the referees body, PGMOL, (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) to change its interpretation of the law back to last season’s approach but that could risk conflict with FIFA and their referee bodies.",

He added: “I am very grateful to Chancellor Merkel for visiting me in hospital.”\n\nThe Navalny case has further worsened relations between Moscow and a number of Western countries.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nThe suspect, who is from Pakistan, was arrested soon after two people were wounded in front of the old offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. Officials said his clothes were spattered in blood.\n\nThe video was found on the suspect’s mobile phone, French media reported. Reuters could not independently authenticate the video recording. A police source confirmed a video was being examined.\n\nIn the video, the suspect identifies himself as Zeheer Hassan Mehmood and says he came from Mandi Bahauddin in Punjab province. Starting to sob, he then recites poetry praising the Prophet Mohammad.\n\n“If I’m sounding emotional, let me explain: here, in France, the caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad were made,” he says in Urdu. “I am going to do (an act of) resistance today, Sept. 25.”\n\nMehmood’s father praised his son.\n\n“My heart is filled with happiness,” Arshad Mehmood told the online news site Naya Pakistan from the family home. “I can sacrifice all my five sons to protect the Prophet’s honour.”\n\n“He called us ... and said that the God’s Prophet had chosen him, and assigned him to kill the blasphemers.”\n\nThe cartoons were first published by Charlie Hebdo in 2006 and spurred Islamist militants to target the magazine’s office in 2015 in an attack that left 12 people dead and was claimed by al Qaeda.\n\nThe weekly, which moved to a secret location after the attack, republished the cartoons earlier this month to mark the beginning of the trial of 14 people with alleged links to the Charlie Hebdo killers.\n\nFor Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.\n\nWearing a long tunic, the suspect said he was spiritually guided by Ilyas Qadri. Qadri is a Sunni cleric and the founder of Dawat-e-Islami, a non-violent organisation spread across the globe.\n\nQadri says a person who commits blasphemy should be handed in to police, but if another individual were driven by their emotions to kill the blasphemer, the law should not apply.\n\nDawat-e-Islami did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

REUTERS/Nick Oxford\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Monday but on track for their first monthly fall since April as rising coronavirus cases continued to spur concerns about demand.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 slipped 3 cents to $41.89 a barrel by 1400 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 was at $40.12 a barrel, down 13 cents or 0.3%.\n\n“The rise in daily infections has accelerated and the total number is now very close to 33 million. The most impacted countries are the populous ones,” PVM analyst Tamas Varga said.\n\n“The speed with which the virus is spreading is the main concern for both health officials and financial investors.”\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that the global oil market has been stable for the past few months and the demand-supply balance restored, but warned of the risks of a second wave of COVID-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile one of the heaviest clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 2016 broke out over the weekend, reigniting concern about stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nDespite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies to limit output, more crude is being exported from OPEC producers Iran and Libya.\n\nOPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that commercial oil inventories in OECD countries are expected to stand only slightly above the five-year average in the first quarter of 2021, before falling below that level for the rest of the year.\n\nA factor that may offer some support to the market is the prospect of industrial action in Norway, where a workers’ strike that may take place on Sept. 30 is threatening to cut its production by 900,000 barrels per day, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (NOG) said on Friday.",

  "text": "FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Shares in Siemens Energy ENR1n.DE opened lower than expected on their first day of trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange, as Germany's biggest-ever spin-off gears up for a challenging future independent from parent Siemens SIEGn.DE.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.\n\n($1 = 0.8589 euros)",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “catastrophic” biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nWith the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.\n\n“We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.”\n\nWithout action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.\n\nScientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge.\n\nWhile Monday’s pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.\n\n“We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,” Canada’s Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.\n\nACTION PLEDGE\n\nIn England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.\n\nHowever, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: “It’s great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there’s no funding.”\n\nThe EU’s executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.\n\nBut so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.\n\nSeparately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.\n\nThe pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nBritain left the EU in January but is currently in a status-quo transition period, which ends on December 31 irrespective of whether or not a deal is agreed. On Monday, the two sides started a decisive week of talks, with one diplomat noting an improvement in “mood music”.\n\nBut all six banks which participated in a Reuters poll in June are more pessimistic, with most citing UK legislation that would breach parts of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU in January.\n\nThe move has drawn threats of legal action from the EU.\n\nThe most dramatic re-assessment was by Societe Generale, which said the bill “gravely damaged” trust. The probability of no-deal now stands at 80%, according to the bank, which had assigned a 17% chance in June.\n\nGermany’s Commerzbank, meanwhile, puts the probability of no-deal at slightly below 50%, versus 10% in June, a scenario which strategist Thu Lan Nguyen warns could hit the pound hard, possibly resulting in depreciation of “something around 10%”.\n\nThe currency has fallen around 5% this month but with three months still to go before the transition period expires, options markets are pricing in more volatility ahead.\n\nING now believes the risk of no deal is 50%, up from 40% three months ago. Only a small proportion of this risk premium is priced by sterling, according to economist James Smith, who sees the currency possibly heading towards parity versus the euro.\n\n(Graphic: How likely is a no-deal Brexit? - )\n\n(Interactive version here of banks' Brexit forecasts)\n\nIn a more detailed forecast, Standard Chartered stuck with a one-in-two chance of an agreement by the end of the year but also saw a 20% chance of the transition period being extended and a 30% chance of exiting without a deal.\n\nJPMorgan, not included in the Reuters poll, expects the worst-case outcome to wipe at least three percentage points off UK gross domestic product in 2021.\n\nIt puts the risk of no-deal at one-in-three but told clients that “with brinkmanship part of the process it may appear higher than that before agreement is reached”.",

While Democrats control the chamber by 232 seats to 198, Republicans control a majority of 26 state delegations, vs. 22 for Democrats. Pennsylvania’s delegation is tied, while Michigan has a 7-6 split between Democrats and Republicans and an additional seat held by a Libertarian.\n\nThe House has not determined the outcome of a presidential election since 1876.\n\nPelosi called on Democrats for “an all out effort” to capture additional Republican-held House seats, which they might need if a decision on the presidential election spills over into next year. She also urged Democrats to marshal resources to support the House Majority PAC, a political action committee committed to promoting Democratic candidates for the House.\n\n“Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats,” Pelosi wrote.\n\nHouse Republicans and their aides were not immediately available for comment. Like Democrats, they too have political operations aimed at expanding their numbers in the House.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined “at this time” to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols’ detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it “will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.”\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump’s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his “blessing.”\n\nBut key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its “ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.”\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational”.\n\n“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on “bullying and extortion”.\n\nTrump’s administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.”\n\nAnother U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings’ WeChat from U.S. app stores.",

  "text": "［東京 ２８日］ - 日銀の金融政策決定会合（９月１５─１６日）は予想通りに金融緩和の現状維持を決定したが、黒田東彦総裁の記者会見では、多くの記者が政府と日銀による「共同声明」の見直しの可能性を質したことが印象的だった。\n\n９月２８日 日銀の金融政策決定会合（９月１５─１６日）は予想通りに金融緩和の現状維持を決定したが、黒田東彦総裁の記者会見では、多くの記者が政府と日銀による「共同声明」の見直しの可能性を質したことが印象的だったと、野村総研の井上哲也氏は指摘する。写真は６月の決定会合後に会見する黒田氏。６月２０日、東京で撮影（２０２０年 ロイター/Kim Kyung-Hoon）\n\n記者による多くの質問は、次の２つの発想に基づいていたようだ。\n\n第１に、菅義偉政権が新たな経済政策を実施するのであれば、政府と日銀との関係も見直すべきという発想だ。現在の「共同声明」は「アベノミクス」の「３本の矢」を具体的に表明したものであるだけに、新たな政策哲学に沿った合意の見直しが必要との考えは自然である。\n\n第２に、これを機に物価目標を見直すべきとの発想だ。日銀は「共同声明」の翌月に就任した黒田総裁の下で実際に「大胆な金融緩和」を実施してきたが、現在に至るまで物価目標を達成できていないので、こうした発想が生じることも理解できる。\n\n＜「共同声明」の見直しに予想される内容＞\n\nただし、現時点で「共同声明」を見直した場合、その焦点は物価目標ではなく、むしろ雇用になる可能性が少なくない。\n\n新政権の喫緊の課題は新型コロナウイルスの感染抑制と経済活動の維持との両立であり、後者については深刻な影響を受けている産業を中心とした雇用の維持が求められる。これまでは企業に対する大規模な財政支出で雇用を下支えしてきたが、今後は「財政の崖」に近づくことが懸念される。\n\nそこで「共同声明」の見直しを行えば、日銀にも雇用維持を担ってもらうべきとの主張が生じうることは想像に難くない。米連邦準備理事会（ＦＲＢ）が、物価安定とともに最大雇用を政策目標にしていることも、こうした意見を後押しするであろう。\n\n実際、日銀に雇用維持の目標を付与しても、大きな問題は生じないように見える。低インフレが定着した日本では、金融緩和を維持すれば、インフレ率を押し上げ雇用を拡大することで２つの目標をともに追求しうるので、目標達成にジレンマが生ずる可能性は低い。\n\nしかも、金融緩和を継続しても高インフレが生ずるリスクはそもそも小さいし、資産価格バブルのリスクも適切に抑制されてきた。また、通貨に対する国際的な信認が不安定化するには時間的猶予がありそうだ。\n\n＜政策手段を巡る議論＞\n\nそれでも、筆者は日銀に雇用維持の目標を付与することには慎重であるべきと考える。雇用の維持が重要課題であることにはもちろん同意するが、これには政府の方が効率的に対応しうる一方、日銀に役割を担わせれば新たな副作用が懸念されるからだ。\n\n日銀による新型コロナ問題への対策においては、無利子・無担保融資を行った金融機関へのバックファイナンスや、社債・ＣＰの買い入れ枠の大幅な拡大など、資金供給の相手や条件、規模の面で、資源配分に対するより直接的な介入を意味するものが含まれることが特徴である。\n\nこれらは中央銀行の機動性を生かした緊急対策として実施されたが、効果的であればあるほど、終了の決定を先送りさせる圧力がかかりやすい。加えてＦＲＢによる金融政策の見直しが示唆するように、適切なインフレ率が存在する物価と異なり、雇用の場合は多ければ多いほど良い点を踏まえると、そうした圧力はなおさら強まりそうである。\n\nこうした状況で日銀に雇用維持の目標を新たに付与すれば、緊急対策の一層の強化と長期化を招くことになろう。今年前半のような緊急時には有効であるこうした政策手段も、常態化すれば市場メカニズムによる経済資源の再配分機能を損ない、ひいては長期的な経済成長率を抑制するリスクが高い。\n\n新型コロナ問題を持続可能な形で克服するには、新たな経済構造へとシフトすることが必要であるからこそ、菅政権も市場メカニズムの活性化を意味する規制緩和を経済政策の重点に置いたと理解できる。それなのに日銀が市場メカニズムを毀損するリスクのある政策を続けるようでは、政府と日銀との経済政策に関する協調にむしろ水を差すことにもなりかねない。\n\n日銀にとっても、危機対策が常態化してしまうと、市場メカニズムに依存した通常の政策手段の効果がむしろ減衰する結果、危機対策に一層依存せざるを得なくなるという悪循環に陥る恐れが大きい。\n\n＜物価目標の政治的な意味＞\n\n一方で、物価目標を「共同声明」の中で維持することには、依然として意味がある。\n\n黒田総裁が記者会見で確認したように、日銀が物価安定を通じて経済の発展に寄与する役割を担うことは日銀法に明記されており、国民の意思を反映して国会が決めたという重い意味を有する。この点自体は、政府と日銀の協議によって変更を加えることのできる次元の問題ではない。\n\nこれを日銀からみれば、日銀法に規定された物価安定を目指して政策を運営する限りは、政策判断の自主性は法的に守られることを意味する。\n\n確かに、日銀が物価目標の意味で物価安定を達成できていない点では、役割を果たしていないという批判も可能ではあるが、これだけ「大胆な金融緩和」でも物価目標が達成しなかっただけに、低インフレの継続が構造的な要素に影響されているとの理解も広く共有されている。\n\nその意味で、今や、物価目標の達成如何が金融政策の信認に深刻な影響を与える状況ではなくなった。\n\nこうした点を踏まえると、記者が提起した問題意識も理解できるが、筆者は「共同声明」を現状のままに維持することの方が望ましいと考える。\n\n＊本コラムは、ロイター外国為替フォーラムに掲載されたものです。筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。\n\n＊井上哲也氏は、野村総合研究所の金融イノベーション研究部主席研究員。１９８５年東京大学経済学部卒業後、日本銀行に入行。米イエール大学大学院留学（経済学修士）、福井俊彦副総裁（当時）秘書、植田和男審議委員（当時）スタッフなどを経て、２００４年に金融市場局外国為替平衡操作担当総括、２００６年に金融市場局参事役（国際金融為替市場）に就任。２００８年に日銀を退職し、野村総合研究所に入社。主な著書に「異次元緩和―黒田日銀の戦略を読み解く」（日本経済新聞出版社、２０１３年）など。\n\n（編集：田巻一彦）\n\n＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。",

  "text": "［ロンドン ２８日 ロイター BREAKINGVIEWS］ - 中国電子商取引大手アリババ・グループBABA.N9988.HK傘下の金融会社アント・グループは、投資家にばらラ色のレンズを通して自社の姿を見せている。アリババの決済会社としてスタートした同社は、創業からわずか１６年で消費者を融資、ファンド、保険と結びつける巨大デジタル仲介企業へと成長した。信用の置けない融資、不明朗な取引、事細かな規制が金融機関を圧迫する中国において、同社はそのビジネスモデルで重圧をかわしている。\n\n９月２８日、中国電子商取引大手アリババ・グループ傘下の金融会社アント・グループは、投資家にばらラ色のレンズを通して自社の姿を見せている。写真は杭州市のアント・グループの事務所で２０１８年１月撮影（２０２０年 ロイター/Shu Zhang）\n\n同社は、２０００億ドル超の企業価値評価を前提に新規株式公開（ＩＰＯ）を計画しているが、そうした評価の実現は、公開市場の投資家が輝かしい企業像を共有してくれることにかかっている。\n\n中国の銀行システムは近年、あまり素晴らしい結果を生み出していない。減速する同国の景気は、大規模な借金に支えられている。国際決済銀行（ＢＩＳ）によると、民間セクターの負債は現在、国内総生産（ＧＤＰ）の２１６％相当。この結果、不良債権は積み上がり、負債を返済できないゾンビ企業が増えている。\n\nしかし香港と上海でのＩＰＯを前に、アントはもっと明るい物語を投資家に伝えている。同社は中国のデジタル金融を築き上げ、日常生活に欠かせない企業となった。６月までの１年間で同社のアプリ「アリペイ」が処理した取引は実に１１８兆元（１７０億ドル）と、同国のオンライン決済の半分以上を占める。\n\nアリペイは金融サービスの「ショーウインドー」でもある。短期の消費者向け融資から零細企業向け融資、投資ファンド、保険商品まで、何でも手に入る。７億人を超える月間ユーザーに対し、リテール銀行としての機能をほとんど提供している上、国が管理する銀行より処理が素早く円滑だ。\n\nしかし重要なのは、アントが銀行ではないという点だ。預金を受け付けておらず、バランスシート上に残っているローンはわずか２％。残りは他の金融機関に移転するか、証券化している。投資商品は関連会社が扱っており、保険商品も大半は第３者が提供するものだ。\n\nこうした仕組みにより、アントは通常の銀行よりもバランスシート対比ではるかに大規模な与信が可能になっている。同社が６月末時点で提供していた消費者向け融資は１兆７０００億元相当。これは中国最大手行、中国工商銀行（ＩＣＢＣ）601398.SS1398.HKが提供している同融資の約４分の１に相当する。しかしＩＣＢＣの資本はアントの１０倍を超え、バランスシートは３３兆元と約１００倍だ。\n\nアントは他社にローンを移転し、「テクノロジー・サービス手数料」を課している。同社は膨大なデータが与信審査の精度を上げていると誇る。今のところ、不良債権比率は低い。コロナ禍の影響にもかかわらず、消費者融資残高のうち返済が３０日以上遅延している割合は３％弱だ。厳しい景気後退が訪れれば、融資を下請けした銀行は損失に見舞われるだろう。それでもアント自体は難を逃れる。与信規模は減少するだろうが。\n\n銀行との重要な違いはもうひとつある。主要な銀行規制当局がアントの事業を直接監督していない上、アントの成長は資本規制の制約に縛られないということだ。\n\n当局も手をこまねいているわけではなく、中国人民銀行（中央銀行）は今月、一部の組織機関を金融持ち株会社に指定して厳しい管理の対象とする新規則を打ち出した。しかし事情に詳しい人々によると、この規則が影響するのはアントの総収入の２―３％にすぎない。しかも同社は子会社を金融持ち株会社に指定したため、親会社はほとんど無傷だ。\n\nアントのビジネスモデルは非常に収益性が高い。１―６月の純利益は２１９億元で、株主資本利益率は年率約２２％に達した。Breakingviewsの計算によると、アントの企業価値は２７５０億ドルと、ＩＣＢＣの２４６０億ドルをも上回る。\n\nしかし、記憶力の良い投資家は警戒を解かないかもしれない。２０１１年に創業者の馬雲（ジャック・マー）氏が株主のソフトバンクやヤフーに知らせないまま、アリペイをアリババから切り離した様子を思い出すだろう。マー氏は外資保有規制のため必要な措置だったと主張したが、これにより同氏はアリペイの支配権を維持することができている。\n\n企業統治の問題を別にしても、アントには疑問が山積している。通常の銀行のような取り付け騒ぎは起こりにくいが、技術上の障害が起こればユーザーの信頼と中国経済に深刻な影響が及びかねない。中国の金融構造において、これほどまで重要性を増している企業を、規制当局が永遠に管轄外に置いておくと考えるのは無理があるだろう。とはいえアントのＩＰＯで成功の鍵を握るのは、新規の投資家がばら色のレンズを手放さずにいてくれることだ。\n\n●背景となるニュース\n\n＊ブルームバーグが２１日に報じたところでは、アント・グループはＩＰＯで少なくとも３５０億ドルの調達を目指している。実現すれば世界最大のＩＰＯとなりそうだ。\n\n＊この目標は２５００億ドル前後の企業価値評価に基づいている。\n\n＊これまでの世界最大のＩＰＯは、サウジアラムコが２０１９年に実施したもので、調達額は２９０億ドルだった。\n\n＊アントは１８日、上海証券取引所から国内でのＩＰＯの承認を得た。香港市場と上海の「科創板（スター・マーケット）」での同時上場を計画している。\n\n（筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています）\n\n＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。",

  "text": "［２４日 ロイター］ - 日本のシルバーウィーク中、ドル／円JPY=EBS相場は７月３１日の安値・ドル１０４．２０円を下抜けし、一時１０４円ちょうどまで下落した。その後、世界的な株式相場の下落に伴うリスクオフがドルの買い戻しを誘い、ドル／円も１０５円台を回復している。しかし、１０４.２０円から当日中に１０６円台を回復した７月３１日に比べると、その戻り歩調は鈍い。\n\n日本のシルバーウィーク中、ドル／円相場は７月３１日の安値・ドル１０４．２０円を下抜けし、一時１０４円ちょうどまで下落した。その後、世界的な株式相場の下落に伴うリスクオフがドルの買い戻しを誘い、ドル／円も１０５円台を回復している。しかし、１０４.２０円から当日中に１０６円台を回復した７月３１日に比べると、その戻り歩調は鈍い。写真は２０１３年２月撮影（２０２０年 ロイター/Shohei Miyano）\n\nこうした値動きも踏まえ、本稿では軟調に推移するドル／円相場の背景を整理した上で、１０５円付近のサポート効果の持続性、円高に対する本邦当局の抑止策の有無、続落した場合の下値めどといった３つの視点を整理しておこう。\n\n＜円高の背景にＦＲＢの平均インフレ目標＞\n\n初めにドル／円下落の主因だが、それはドル安だろう。\n\n米連邦準備理事会（ＦＲＢ）は８月２７日、金融政策の長期的な目標と戦略を変更。２％超えのインフレを容認し、雇用が十分に回復するまで粘り強く低金利政策を継続する姿勢を打ち出した。コロナショック以前でさえ、米国でもインフレ率が平均的にみて２％に達した時期は、原油価格が高騰した局面を除けばほとんどないに等しい。２０２０年代のかなりの期間にわたり、米国の低金利時代が続く見込みだ。\n\nかねて指摘の通り、対内証券投資などにより、経常赤字を賄うべき米国が、リスクに見合う金利水準を提示できなければ、あとはドル安によってドル建て資産の割安感を演出するほかない。しかも、コロナショック対応の資金供給も一因に、市場に出回るドルの流動性の目安であるワールドダラーも２０１５年以来の水準を回復。ドル資金の逼迫（ひっぱく）感による為替市場でのドル下支え効果も和らぐ可能性が高い。\n\nもっとも、４月２３日付コラム、『「大封鎖」で変わる通貨の勢力図、ドル独り勝ちは続かず』でも示した通り、未曾有の経済危機の下、為替市場ではドルも一定の強さを維持しよう。ドル安が進むのは、あくまでもＧ１０かつ経常黒字国かつ非資源国通貨に限られるとみられ、具体的には円やユーロ、スイスフラン、スウェーデンクローナとなろう。\n\nまた、ユーロは難航必至の対英ＦＴＡ（自由貿易協定）交渉や新型コロナウイルスの感染再拡大を受けて、上昇が一服している。空前の規模に膨れ上がった投機筋のユーロロングも、損益確定のユーロ売りがしばらく優勢となる可能性を示す。このため、年内に限ればドル安の受け皿役からユーロが脱落。ドル安の矛先が円に向けられる危険性もありそうだ。\n\n＜１０４円台のサポートは弱体化＞\n\n以下では、３つの視点を整理しよう。まず、１０５円付近から１０４円台でのサポートは今後も機能するだろうか。結論を言えば、その効果は徐々に弱体化するおそれが強い。それは、本邦勢の円売り需要が弱まる可能性があるためだ。足元では、コロナ禍の長期化が見込まれ、世界経済の先行きに対する不確実性が強い。金融市場が再び不安定化する可能性も考慮すると、対外投資は手控えられている。\n\n例えば、年初来７月までの日本の対外直接投資（国際収支ベース、ネット）は前年比で約５兆円減少。８月までの対外証券投資（指定報告機関ベース、ネット）も約３兆円減少している。加えて、為替ヘッジコストが大幅に低下したことを踏まえれば、証券投資のうち、中長期債投資については為替スポット相場に影響しないヘッジ付外債投資の妙味（＝ヘッジコスト勘案後の当初利回り）が上昇している。\n\n依然として、超低金利に直面する多くの本邦機関投資家にとり、外貨建て資産投資は不可避だが、従来に比べると円売り需要が衰えたり、円売り（ドル買い）を実施する目線がドル安・円高方向へと修正される結果、１０５円付近でのサポートに対する信認が低下し、その頑健性が衰える可能性が高い。\n\n＜円高防止に日銀のＥＴＦ買い増しも＞\n\n次に、１０５円割れが定着するような円高が進行した際に、本邦の通貨当局にそれを抑制する有効な手段はあるだろうか。現実問題として捉えると、切ることができるカードは多くないだろう。\n\n例えば、為替市場への介入は、市場が投機的であるなど、真にやむを得ない場合に限られるとの不文律が浸透している。もちろん、ドル／円が急落した場合、それが投機的かどうかの判断は各国に委ねられている面もあり、為替介入が完全に封じ込められているわけではない。\n\nしかし、経常収支不均衡を是正する重要なメカニズムの１つが為替相場の調整であると、かつて大統領経済報告に明記したこともあるトランプ政権に対し、「船出」間もない菅義偉政権が正面から挑むのが得策かと言えば、異なる判断がなされよう。大統領選と議会選挙をバイデン前副大統領や民主党が制した場合も、より保護主義色が強い政党だけに、為替介入のハードルが低くなることはなさそうだ。\n\nもとより、ドル／円下落の主因がドル安である限り、本邦による単独介入の正当化は容易ではなかろう。結局、一段と円高が進行した際の選択肢は、例えば円高を助長しかねない株安を阻止するため、日銀が金融緩和の名目で、株式上場投資信託（ＥＴＦ）を買い増しするなど、限られるのではないか。\n\n＜意識される購買力平価１００円＞\n\n最後に１０５円割れが定着した場合の下値めどをどうみるか。市場では、購買力平価が意識されそうだ。世界銀行が今年５月に公表した国際比較プログラム（ＩＣＰ）によれば、２０１７年時点の購買力平価（ＰＰＰ）は１０５.３８円。これを用いた昨年末のＰＰＰは１０１.４７円であり、日米インフレ格差を考慮すれば今年末のＰＰＰは１００円に迫ろう。\n\nもちろん世界銀行もＰＰＰは統計上の推計値に過ぎず、概算値として扱う必要があること、通貨の過小または過大評価を示す指標ではないことを明記しているが、ＩＣＰは１７６カ国が参加の上で実施された世界最大規模の統計事業だ。ビッグマック指数などとは異なり、幅広い財とサービスの価格やこうした商品への総支出額のデータを収集して算出された言わば究極の絶対的購買力平価と言え、恣意性がかなり排除された数字とみて差し支えない。切りのいい数字である１００円に、こうしたＰＰＰの意味合いも伴えば、１０５円を下抜けした場合に、市場が次なる節目としてその水準を意識しても何ら不思議はないだろう。\n\n一方、過去を振り返れば購買力平価通りに実際のドル／円が推移したことも珍しく、その意味ではドル／円が必ずしもＰＰＰに収れんする必要はない。とは言え、このことはドル／円が下落する際、ＰＰＰで下げ止まらない可能性も同時に示唆する。 実際、ドル／円の歴史をひも解けば、経常黒字や低インフレ（またはデフレ）などを背景に、購買力平価よりもドル安・円高で推移した時期の方が圧倒的に長い。折しもコロナ禍に覆われた日本経済は、今やデフレ回帰の崖っぷちに立たされている。 結局、ドル／円の下値めどとして１００円付近が機能するのかどうかは、スガノミクスにも大いに依存すると言えそうだ。\n\n＊本稿は、ロイター外国為替フォーラムに掲載されたものです。筆者の個人的見解に基づいています。\n\n＊内田稔氏は、三菱ＵＦＪ銀行グローバルマーケットリサーチのチーフアナリスト。慶應義塾大学法学部政治学科卒業後、東京銀行（現・三菱ＵＦＪ銀行）に入行。２０１２年より現職。J-money誌の東京外国為替市場調査ファンダメンタルズ分析部門では２０１３年から１９年まで個人ランキング１位。国際公認投資アナリスト、証券アナリストジャーナル編集委員。\n\n＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。",

  "text": "［東京 １６日］ - 初秋の外為市場でドル／円JPY=EBSの動意欠乏症が再発している。８月２７日に米連邦準備理事会（ＦＲＢ）が物価目標２％を平均で目指す方針を示して米長期金利が急上昇すると一時１０６円９５銭付近まで浮上したが、翌２８日に安倍晋三首相が辞意を表明すると一転反落、一時１０５円２０銭前後まで軟化した。\n\n９月１６日、初秋の外為市場でドル／円の動意欠乏症が再発している。写真は衆院の首相指名選挙で投票に向かう菅義偉氏（２０２０年 ロイター/Kim Kyung-Hoon）\n\n安倍氏の後継者として、同政権をおよそ８年にわたり官房長官として支えてきた菅義偉氏が１６日の臨時国会で次期首相に指名されたが、今のところ為替はほとんど動いていない。\n\n同氏が９月２日に行った自民党総裁選への出馬会見で「アベノミクスの継承」を訴えると、思惑主導の円高は一服。その後は１０５円台前半で下げ渋る様子が観測された。市場は同氏が進める「スガノミクス」を「アベノミクス」の二番煎じとみているせいか、次期政権による政策展開への関心は盛り上がっていない。\n\nこの先もしばらくの間、ドル／円は狭いレンジで「円高になりそうでならない」展開が続きそうだ。夏場以降、どちらかと言えば円高気味の気配が強いので、７月末に約３０時間だけみた１０４円台が再現されたら買ってみたいが、前回同様、滞在時間は短いだろう。\n\n当面は１ドル＝１０５円─１１０円をコア・レンジにして、上下どちらかにヒゲが伸びてもすぐに短く刈り込まれ、極端な円高も円安も進まない状況が続くとみている。以下、そのように考えている理由を２つ挙げておく。\n\n＜利上げから遠い日米、動かぬ金利差＞\n\n第１に、日米の政策金利は既にほぼ下限近くまで引き下げられている。この先、少なくとも数年間はどちらも利上げがなさそうなので、日米金利差はほとんど動かなくなるだろう。\n\nまず米国サイドに目をやると、米ＦＲＢの物価目標が「平均２％」に改められたことで、「ほぼゼロ金利政策」の長期化観測が強まっている。米国のインフレ率の平均値が２％になるのは相当先になりそうであり、米国の債券市場では残存満期４年あたりまでの国債利回りが翌日物政策金利の誘導目標である０．０─０．２５％の圏内に収まっている。\n\n一方、日本では安倍氏による辞意表明の直後こそアベノミクスの打ち切り観測が台頭したが、第２次安倍内閣の発足当時からの官房長官だった菅氏が「次の首相」の座を射止めたため、そのような観測は急速に下火になった。\n\n現在、日本のコアインフレ率は前年比プラス０．０％界隈で米国以上に低迷している。菅･新首相の持論である携帯料金の４割引き下げが実施された場合、日本の消費者物価は０．８％程度下がるため、実現したら日本は再びデフレに戻るかもしれない。経済の低体温症が米国より深刻な日本が先に利上げに踏み切る可能性は非常に低い。\n\n日銀が物価目標をかつての１％に戻せば利上げの条件は低くなるが、第２次安倍内閣が発足した後の１３年１月、政府と日銀は政策連携を結んで「物価目標２％」を目指す方針を共同声明に明記している。\n\n日銀のホームページに今もアップされているこの声明文の作成には、当時官房長官だった菅氏も深く関わっており、内閣府と財務省の同意なしには、内容を変更したり、削除したり出来ない仕組みになっている。\n\nそのような状況下、「日米の政策金利差は少なくとも今後数年間は動かなくなる」との見方が市場に浸透しつつある。両国の金利差だけでドル／円の方向性が１００％決まる訳ではないが、注目テーマの栄枯盛衰がかなり激しい外為市場にあって、時宜に応じた影響の濃淡こそあれ、為替関係者の期待形成に一番響く中心的な要素は、やはり「金利差」だ。\n\nドル／円相場の行方を示す水先案内人となるべき米日金利差が、この先数年間にわたって休眠状態になった場合、為替の水準と無関係にどちらか片側の通貨だけを一方的に売り続けたり、買い続けたりする気概を持つプレーヤーは減るだろう。「金利差」をテーマにしたドル／円のトレンド形成は、しばらく封印されそうだ。\n\n＜様変わりした日本の貿易体質＞\n\n第２に、近年の日本で起きている国際収支の構造変化が、極端なドル高も円高も起きにくい状態を助長している。２０１７年１月の米トランプ政権発足後、「米中対立の激化」、「戦後最悪のコロナ不況」など、歴史的な経済・政治環境の激変に接しても、ドル／円はなぜか昔のように荒ぶる様子を見せず、滞空時間の約９９％を１０４円台─１１４円台までの狭い値幅で過ごしてきた。\n\n為替の変動を最終的に決めているのは需給なので、「３年８カ月もの長期にわたってドル／円が狭い値幅のレンジ取引につかまっている」という事実そのものが、この間のドル／円絡みの基礎的需給がドル高一辺倒にも円高一直線にも傾いていなかったことの何よりの証左だ。その前には無かった為替需給構造の変化が起きていたに違いない。\n\nそこで改めて近年の日本の国際収支を眺めてみると、平成の御世に起きた日本の産業構造の変化や国際競争力の低下により、今の日本は１ドル＝１１０円前後の為替でも昔のような貿易黒字を稼げない体質の国に変わっている。\n\n現在、新型コロナウイルスが引き起こした不況の影響で日本の貿易・サービス収支は小幅な赤字や黒字を往ったり来たりしており、対外援助や仕送りなどの移転収支も小幅な赤字だ。総じてみれば、実需決済に絡む片道切符の為替フローは、極端な円不足にも円余剰にもなっていないと推測される。\n\n結果的に、近年の日本では、「海外からの利息や配当で稼いだ黒字を、対外直接投資や証券投資で海外に還流する」という国際収支のループ構造が定着しつつある。本邦からの対外投資はドル高が進み過ぎると割高感から流出の勢いが鈍って極端なドル高にブレーキをかける一方、ドル安が進み過ぎると値頃感から流出額が増して極端なドル安にも歯止めをかける需給調節の役割を果たす。\n\nこの点に関して、業界関係者に話を聞くと、日本の大手機関投資家による対外債券投資は、１ドル＝１０５円を割り込んでくると為替の水準に反比例して流出量が増す一方、同１１０円を超えると勢いが止まったり、先物でのドル売り予約が増えたりしやすい傾向があるようだ。\n\n近年の外国為替市場で円絡みの為替取引に圧倒的な流動性を供給している日本の店頭外国為替保証金取引（ＦＸ）の業界でも、今年３月に起きた第１次コロナパニックの局面で、１ドル＝１０５円前後の水準から下のレベルで非常に強いドル買い興味が示された一方、同１１０円前後まで切り返してきた場面では一転して売り興味の方が強まる傾向が観測されていた。\n\n＜相場こう着でドル／円パッシングも＞\n\nドル／円市場を舞台に上下どちらかへの強いトレンドが発生するためには、為替の水準と関係なくどちらか一方の通貨だけをずっと買い続けたり、売り続けたりするフローの担い手が必要だが、現在の局面では、ある程度までドル安が進むと下値を買って円高にブレーキをかける勢力はいるものの、ドルの水準を顧みることなく上値を追いかけて買い続けるプレーヤーも見当たらない。\n\n日米金利差がほとんど動かなくなり、為替需給も拮抗しているとみられる中、ドル／円相場に派手な値動きや骨太のトレンド形成を期待するのはしばらく無理筋だ。１１月３日の米大統領選挙を目前に控え、「政治ネタ」に敏感なプレーヤーが多いドル／円市場では、様子見ムードが強まりやすいだろう。\n\n「動かぬドル／円」と無理に付き合っていても、甲論乙駁（こうろんおつばく）の情報が飛び交う市場環境の中では、本当にいろいろなことを考えさせられて疲れる割に、短期の為替回転売買から得られる期待収益は薄い。\n\n組織のルールや実需の縛りがない市場参加者の間では、比較的派手な値動きが期待できそうな欧州通貨や資源国通貨に売買の主戦場を移す「ドル／円パッシング」も起きている。この秋、ドル円相場に関しては、「観るも相場」に徹するのも一計ではないかと考えている。\n\n＊本コラムは、ロイター外国為替フォーラムに掲載されたものです。筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。\n\n＊植野大作氏は、三菱ＵＦＪモルガン・スタンレー証券のチーフ為替ストラテジスト。１９８８年、野村総合研究所入社。２０００年に国際金融研究室長を経て、０４年に野村証券に転籍、国際金融調査課長として為替調査を統括、０９年に投資調査部長。同年７月に外為どっとコム総合研究所の創業に参画、１２月より主席研究員兼代表取締役社長。１２年４月に三菱ＵＦＪモルガン・スタンレー証券入社、１３年４月より現職。０５年以降、日本経済新聞社主催のアナリスト・ランキングで５年連続為替部門１位を獲得。\n\n＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。",

  "text": "［ニューヨーク ２４日 ロイター BREAKINGVIEWS］ - 著名な米ハイテク株が最近、きな臭い動きを示している。このセクターが最近荒れている背景には、未曽有の規模に膨らんだテスラ株TSLA.Oやアップル株AAPL.Oの金融派生商品（デリバティブ）取引があるのかもしれない。ロビンフッドなど一部のプラットフォームが提供する安価な、もしくは無料の取引により、個人投資家は株式オプションを用いて安くレバレッジをかけることが可能になった。手数料なしの取引には、意図せざる代償が伴うかもしれない。\n\n９月２４日、著名な米ハイテク株が最近、きな臭い動きを示している。ニューヨーク証券取引所前で９日撮影（２０２０年 ロイター/Carlo Allegri）\n\n８月はボラティリティーの高まりをよそに、テスラ株が７０％余り急騰するなど不可解な株価の急上昇が見られた。９月になるとアップル株が１５％超下落したのを含め、相場が大きく下げた。\n\n株式を特定の価格で買う権利であるコールオプションが、不安定な相場の一因かもしれない。ＣＢＯＥグローバル・マーケッツによると、米国株の個別銘柄を原資産とするオプション取引の１日平均出来高は８月に過去最高を更新した。オプションズ・クリアリング・コーポレーションのデータによると、小口投資家によるコールの買いは先月、概算で約５０００億ドル相当となった。\n\nこうした状況下で「デルタヘッジ」と呼ばれる手法により、相場の変動が増幅したとみられる。デルタとは、原資産である株式の値動きによってオプション価格がどの程度変動するかを示す推計値だ。ウォール街のマーケットメイカー（値付け業者）がコールを売る場合、ヘッジするために原資産の株式を何株買えばよいかがデルタで示される。投資家が短期のコールを買えば、コールの売り手による現物株の買いが当該銘柄の価格を押し上げる可能性がある。\n\nソフトバンクグループがハイテク株のデリバティブに４０億ドルを投じたと報じられたが、これは市場で起こっていることの全貌とはほど遠い。実際ブルームバーグによると、同社の取引はおそらく期間が長めで、デルタには中立的なものだったため、市場への影響は小さかったと考えられる。\n\n英紙フィナンシャル・タイムズによると、手数料がこれほど低くては利益を上げにくいため、シティグループは個人向けオプション取引のマーケットメイク業務から撤退する方針だ。手数料の低下がデイトレーダーのオプション取引への投資意欲をかき立てているのなら、シタデル・セキュリティーズなど残る仲介業者が首尾よく対応し、トレーダーの儲けを小さくするはずだ。\n\nそうならない場合でも、相場下落の現実味は消えない。相場の急騰後に反落するには格好の環境であり、個人投資家は賭けた金額をすべて失うリスクが生じる。しかもこうした取引は、資本配分というよりスロットマシン遊びに近く、市場機能への貢献という点でも大いに疑問がある。\n\n以前は手数料が高かったため、個人投資家がオプション取引を手控えていたのかもしれない。規制当局が個人のオプション取引を制限する方法としては、他の投機的取引と同様、特定の取引に対する課税が挙げられそうだ。市場は多少障害がある方がうまく機能することもあるものだ。\n\n●背景となるニュース\n\n＊ＣＢＯＥグローバル・マーケッツによると、米国株の個別銘柄を原資産とするオプション取引の１日平均出来高は２０２０年に大きく増え、８月は過去最高の１８００万枚余りに達した。\n\n＊２３日付の英紙フィナンシャル・タイムズによると、シティグループは個人向けオプション取引のマーケットメイク事業を閉鎖する方針。\n\n（筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています）\n\n＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。",

  "text": "(Reuters) - Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden face off on Tuesday in a televised presidential debate, part of a 60-year-old tradition marked by some of the most memorable moments of modern U.S. political history:\n\nSlideshow ( 13 images )\n\n- 1960: The first televised debate pitted Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o’clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.\n\n- 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.” Carter won the election.\n\n- 1980: Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who already had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: “There you go again” and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election.\n\n- 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: “I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” Reagan was re-elected.\n\n- 1988: A debate against Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed “the iceman” by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Bush won the election.\n\nThe vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Bush’s running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.”\n\n- 1992: Three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Clinton won the election.\n\n- 1996: In a debate with Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: “I can only tell you that I don’t think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It’s the age of his ideas that I question.” Clinton was re-elected.\n\n- 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W. Bush, Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. “We all make mistakes. I’ve been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,” Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing “syllable.” Bush won the election.\n\n- 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.\n\n- 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain’s running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: “Aw, say it ain’t so, Joe,” adding a “doggone it” for good measure. Biden and Palin both vowed to make U.S. economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Biden said McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election.\n\n- 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had “binders full of women” as candidates for Cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Romney. Obama won again.\n\n- 2016: The first debate between Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Clinton jabbing at Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate’s husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage and she wondered if she should have told him to “back up, you creep.” Instead she said, “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” In the third debate Trump called Clinton “such a nasty woman” and declined to say he would accept the election results.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden square off on Tuesday in their first presidential debate. With five weeks to go until the Nov. 3 general election, the stakes are high.\n\nMembers of the news media arrive in the hall ahead of the first presidential debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S., September 28, 2020. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nHere are five things to watch for during the 90-minute televised debate in Cleveland:\n\nFLASHPOINTS\n\nThe face-to-face match-up comes after the New York Times revealed that Trump, a wealthy former businessman and reality television star, paid only $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017.\n\nThe report, which Trump called “total fake news,” gives Biden a fresh opening to make his case that his working-class roots better position him to understand the economic struggles of everyday Americans than the billionaire occupying the White House.\n\nTrump also faced persistent questions, based on his statements about a rigged election, about whether he will accept the voting results should he lose. With millions at home watching, how will he respond if Biden pushes him to commit to a peaceful transfer of power?\n\nBoth candidates will scuffle over Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump is using his pick to rally his conservative voter base and distract from his record on the coronavirus and other matters, while Biden is warning of threats to health care and abortion rights.\n\nBIDEN’S MOMENT\n\nFor Biden, the debate will serve as sort of a reintroduction. While he has held limited events in some states and given media interviews, the coronavirus pandemic has largely rendered him off stage for months.\n\nThat has allowed Biden to keep the focus where he wants it: on Trump and his performance in office. But on Tuesday, the Democratic nominee will have to make his own case for the presidency, while giving concise answers and avoiding some of the verbal mishaps that have plagued him throughout his political career.\n\nWith Biden leading in polls, a strong outing could place Trump in even worse shape. A weak one could reshape the race.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nOWNING IT\n\nFaced with alarming coronavirus statistics or unrest in the streets, Trump is quick to blame Democratic officials, activists, scientists – anybody but him. One of Biden’s goals will be making sure the public understands that Trump is the one in charge.\n\nTrump could use his office to his advantage, as he often tries to do with the economy. Voters like to see a president take responsibility – for the good and the bad.\n\nJohn Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, wonders if Trump will react poorly to sharp or unfriendly queries from moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. “Will Trump have a tough time answering non-softball questions?” Geer said.\n\nTWISTING THE TRUTH\n\nAs Trump’s campaign rallies show, he can fire off falsehoods in machine-gun fashion. Examples include the Republican’s common claim that the U.S. economy was operating at historic levels before the pandemic (it wasn’t) and that the virus has largely dissipated (it hasn’t).\n\nAttempting to constantly pin Trump to the truth could turn Biden into a real-time fact-checker - possibly to the Democrat’s detriment.\n\n“It’s a big mistake to try and do that,” said Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan. “You have to focus on your own agenda.”\n\nDOWN IN THE MUD\n\nBiden has worried aloud about reacting to Trump’s propensity for ad hominem attacks. On the campaign trail, the former vice president has sometimes shown flashes of temper, getting his “Irish up” as he calls it.\n\nTrump in a tweet on Sunday went as far as to suggest Biden will be on performance-enhancing drugs during the debate, signaling that perhaps there is little he will not do or say to rattle Biden and disrupt the proceedings.\n\nPolls show that Trump’s frequent questioning of the 77-year-old Biden’s mental fitness has registered with some voters. Trump’s team will be looking for moments where Biden seems flustered or unsure to exploit as viral video.\n\n“If the president lies, call it a lie. If he attacks Biden personally, just shrug it off and not get personal,” Geer said. “Biden needs to continue to be presidential and tough, even if there is some mud on his suit jacket.”",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing tax-return data.\n\nIn a report that Trump dismissed as “fake news,” the Times said the Republican president also paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017, despite receiving $427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.\n\nThe disclosure of previously private tax information came little more than a month before the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Democrats were quick to seize on the report to paint Trump as a tax dodger and raise questions about his carefully groomed image as a savvy businessman.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to ask Americans to raise their hands if they paid more in federal income tax than Trump.\n\nCalling the report “total fake news” at a White House news conference, Trump again cited an ongoing audit as his reason for not releasing his returns. In a statement to the Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said Trump had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade, without weighing in on the specific finding of minimal income taxes.\n\nTrump’s consistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates. He is currently in a legal battle with New York City prosecutors and congressional Democrats who are seeking to obtain his returns.\n\nHe also previously indicated he preferred to minimize his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him “smart.”\n\nThe Times reported that Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire. It said he claimed $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite saying he had income of at least $434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.\n\nThe Times emphasized the documents reveal only what Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth.\n\nThe Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization. It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.\n\nThe Times also reported that Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service audit over a $72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him in that audit, he could have to pay over $100 million, according to the newspaper.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, will begin meeting with senators this week as Republicans push ahead with a rapid Senate confirmation process ahead of November’s presidential election over the objections of Democrats.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett stands as U.S President Donald Trump holds an event to announce her as his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18, at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nTrump on Saturday announced Barrett, 48, as his selection to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 at age 87. Barrett, who would be the fifth woman to serve on the high court, said she would be a justice in the mold of the late staunch conservative Antonin Scalia.\n\nHer confirmation by the Senate would result in a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate and are aiming to hold a vote before the Nov. 3 election, in accordance with Trump’s wishes.\n\nTrump, who is running for a second term against Democrat Joe Biden, has said he wants nine justices on the court so that it will have a full complement to tackle any election-related legal issues and possibly decide the outcome in his favor.\n\nThe only time in U.S. history the Supreme Court has had to resolve a presidential election was in 2000.\n\nBarrett is set to start meeting with senators ahead of a multi-day confirmation hearing scheduled to begin on Oct. 12, when she will face questions about her judicial philosophy and approach to the law.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the committee, told Fox News on Sunday that the panel will likely vote on the nomination on Oct. 22, setting up a final vote on the Senate floor by the end of the month.\n\nDemocrats object to Republicans pushing through the nomination so close to the election, saying that the winner of the contest should get to pick the nominee.\n\nTrump’s nomination of Barrett is the first time since 1956 that a U.S. president has moved to fill a Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\n\nDemocratic opposition to Barrett has so far been focused on her possible role as a deciding vote in a case before the Supreme Court in which Trump and fellow Republicans are asking the justices to strike down the Obamacare health law known formally as the Affordable Care Act. If confirmed quickly, Barrett could be on the bench when the justices hear oral arguments on Nov. 10.\n\nA key provision of the law that would be thrown out if the court struck it down requires insurance companies to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSome Democrats have said they will refuse to meet with Barrett but others, including some on the committee, have said they intend to engage in the process so they can ask Barrett directly about issues such as healthcare and abortion.\n\nConservative activists are hoping that a 6-3 conservative majority will move the court to the right by curbing abortion rights, expanding gun rights and upholding voting restrictions.\n\nDemocrats are likely to seek a pledge from Barrett that she would recuse herself if election-related issues reach the court next month.",

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

REUTERS/Al Drago\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is rallying Democrats to prepare for a once-in-a-century election scenario requiring Congress to decide the outcome of the presidential race, if neither Democrat Joe Biden nor President Donald Trump wins outright.\n\nIn a campaign letter to colleagues, Pelosi told her fellow House Democrats that recent comments by Trump demonstrate that he could ask the House to decide the race if it is not clear which of the two had received the minimum 270 Electoral College votes in the Nov. 3 presidential election to gain office.\n\nTrump repeatedly has questioned the security of mail-in ballots, which could take a while to tabulate given the high number of voters likely to opt for using them this year.\n\nDemocrats fear that the president could attempt to have the count of those votes cut short in an attempt to have the election outcome determined by the House.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House would vote by state delegation to settle such a contest, with each state casting a single vote. While Democrats control the chamber by 232 seats to 198, Republicans control a majority of 26 state delegations, vs. 22 for Democrats. Pennsylvania’s delegation is tied, while Michigan has a 7-6 split between Democrats and Republicans and an additional seat held by a Libertarian.\n\nThe House has not determined the outcome of a presidential election since 1876.\n\nPelosi called on Democrats for “an all out effort” to capture additional Republican-held House seats, which they might need if a decision on the presidential election spills over into next year. She also urged Democrats to marshal resources to support the House Majority PAC, a political action committee committed to promoting Democratic candidates for the House.\n\n“Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats,” Pelosi wrote.\n\nHouse Republicans and their aides were not immediately available for comment. Like Democrats, they too have political operations aimed at expanding their numbers in the House.",

They said their son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nA couple of months later the school authorities informed him he would no longer teach kindergarten children, he said. “I think the decision they took was quite sad,” said Helaine.\n\nA spokesman for the local education authority said an agreement was reached with Helaine to move him away from teaching kindergarten. Pupils under six “could be frightened by his appearance”, the spokesman said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. “I’m a primary school teacher ... I love my job.”\n\nHe said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an “existential crisis”. Since then, he said, “Getting tattoos is my passion.”\n\nHe said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. “Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,” he said.",

REUTERS/Angus Mordant\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Monday but on track for their first monthly fall since April as rising coronavirus cases continued to spur concerns about demand.\n\nBrent crude slipped 3 cents to $41.89 a barrel by 1400 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate was at $40.12 a barrel, down 13 cents or 0.3%.\n\n“The rise in daily infections has accelerated and the total number is now very close to 33 million.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium August 21, 2020. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nThe proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.\n\nWarsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.\n\nIn the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.\n\n“The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,” reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nBut the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders’ summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber.\n\nLiberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber’s work on the matter, said Berlin was “cuddling” with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest.\n\n“Without an automatic sanction system, Germany’s proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,” he told Reuters when asked about the scheme.\n\nAccording to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU’s executive European Commission.\n\nThis could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary.\n\nBut those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law.\n\nThat formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.\n\n“FINGER-WAGGING”\n\nSome have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.\n\n“It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn’t find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,” said one official working on the matter.\n\nGermany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc’s next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021.\n\nAsked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.\n\n“There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn’t like our government,” he told reporters.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.8568 euros)",

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nThe clashes over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh are the heaviest since 2016, with reports of dozens of deaths and hundreds wounded.\n\nArmenia’s ambassador to Moscow said on Monday that Turkey had sent around 4,000 fighters from northern Syria to Azerbaijan and that they were fighting there, an assertion denied by an aide to Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev.\n\nArmenia also said Turkish military experts were fighting alongside Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous breakaway region of Azerbaijan run by ethnic Armenians, and that Turkey had provided drones and warplanes.\n\nAzerbaijan denied the reports. Turkey did not immediately comment, although senior officials including President Tayyip Erdogan, who has increasingly been flexing Turkey’s military muscle abroad, have promised support for Baku.\n\nThe two fighters, from Turkish-backed rebel groups in areas of northern Syria under Turkish control, said they were deploying to Azerbaijan in coordination with Ankara.\n\nThey declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Reuters could not independently verify their accounts.\n\n“I didn’t want to go, but I don’t have any money. Life is very hard and poor,” said a fighter who had fought in Syria for Ahrar al-Sham, a group that Turkey has supported.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\n$1,500 A MONTH\n\nBoth men said they had been told by their Syrian brigade commanders they would earn around $1,500 a month - a large wage for Syria, where the economy and currency have collapsed.\n\nThe fighter said he had arranged his assignment with an official from the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) in Afrin, a region of northwest Syria seized by Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies two years ago.\n\nA spokesman for the SNA, an umbrella group of Syrian rebel groups backed by Turkey, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other fighter, from the SNA-affiliated Jaish al-Nukhba militia, said he had been told nearly 1,000 Syrians were set to be deployed to Azerbaijan. Other rebels, who also declined to be named, gave figures of between 700 and 1,000.\n\nThe two men, who spoke to Reuters last week, said they expected to be despatched on Sept. 25, to guard facilities but not to fight. Reuters was not able to contact them on Monday to confirm their location.\n\nHikmat Hajiyev, a foreign policy aide to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said it was “complete nonsense” to say Syrian fighters were coming to help his country: “Our armed forces have more than enough personnel and reserve forces.”\n\nIn recent years, Turkey has projected growing power abroad with incursions into neighbouring Syria and Iraq, and military support for the internationally recognised government in Libya.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly said it is also ready to provide support to Azerbaijan, with which it has strong historical and cultural ties and runs joint energy projects.\n\nRIVALRY WITH RUSSIA\n\nDefence Minister Hulusi Akar attended joint military drills in Azerbaijan in August, and Erdogan used his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last week to accuse Armenia of attacking its neighbour.\n\nConcern that Turkey could get more involved in the conflict helped drag its currency to a record low against the dollar on Monday.\n\nMustafa Sejari, a senior Syrian rebel, did not confirm the deployment of fighters to Azerbaijan but said Turkey was the “only hope” left for opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken most rebel-held land in Syria with Russian and Iranian support.\n\n“Our alliance with (Turkey) takes different forms and is truly a common fate,” he said. “I don’t rule out at all Turkey becoming a strategic choice for Syrian youths.”\n\nTurkey has already used Syrian fighters to help block an assault on the Libyan capital Tripoli earlier this year by General Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, backed by Russia among others.\n\nTheir use in Syria would create a third theatre for Turkey’s regional rivalry with Moscow, which has a military base in Armenia, considers it a strategic partner in the South Caucasus, and supplies it with weapons. It has not commented on the reports of Syrian fighters being sent to Azerbaijan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was following the situation very closely and that the conflict had to be resolved through diplomacy.",

  "text": "PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM AIRF.PA is battling new green taxes on top of the coronavirus crisis - in a test of growing policy tensions between righting Europe's crippled airlines and delivering on climate goals.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The first Air France airliner's Airbus A350 takes off after a ceremony at the aircraft builder's headquarters in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe Franco-Dutch group, sustained by 10.4 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in state-backed loans, faces higher duties in both home markets as well as EU plans to hike airlines’ carbon costs.\n\nThe struggle unfolding around Air France-KLM is part of a larger reckoning for carbon-intensive industries as efforts to tackle global warming spawn more taxes and regulation.\n\nWhile campaigners say those are long overdue, crisis-hit airlines warn their timing and severity will cost thousands more jobs and hurt development of lower-carbon technologies.\n\nNew taxes “do not support emissions reductions”, said Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith in response to proposed increases to French passenger duties.\n\n“In fact it’s counterproductive and would deprive us of finances that could otherwise be invested in environmental projects,” he told an online industry forum this month.\n\nTensions can only rise as emissions goals are toughened to slow dangerous climate change. The European Union’s executive now wants to cut greenhouse gas output by 55% in the next decade rather than the previous 40%, from a 1990 baseline.\n\nWhile the pandemic has dampened climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, their political legacy must be squared with the economic emergency.\n\nGREEN WAVE\n\nFrench municipal elections saw the ecologist EELV party take Lyon, Bordeaux and Strasbourg in a June 28 “Green Wave”. The next day, President Emmanuel Macron promised to advance 146 proposals from a “citizens’ climate convention”.\n\nThose include an airline duty increase to 30 euros per short-haul economy passenger and 400 euros for long-haul business, from their current 1.50-18 euro range. At 2019 traffic, officials say the sector would pay 4.2 billion euros.\n\nKey members of the government, which underwrote 7 billion euros for Air France, are backing away from the pledge as officials draft legislation in response to the convention.\n\n“It would be grotesque to take back with one hand what we’d given the sector with the other,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told daily Les Echos.\n\nLe Maire and his Dutch counterpart were among nine EU finance ministers who had called for “taxation or similar policies” to curb emissions by raising air fares.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, the Netherlands is introducing passenger duties worth 220 million euros at pre-crisis traffic. A Greenpeace legal challenge is also demanding steeper emissions cuts in return for KLM’s 3.4 billion-euro aid package.\n\nOFFSETS UPSET\n\nAirline emissions account for 2.5% of the global total but are set to triple by 2050. Under a U.N.-brokered programme, CORSIA, the industry aims to counter emissions growth from international flights with carbon offsets, whose effects are contested.\n\nAirbus AIR.PA has given itself until 2035 to put a \"zero-emission\" plane into service, but many are sceptical about that deadline. Synthetic fuels are also too scarce and expensive to offer a near-term solution.\n\nFor intra-European flights, airlines would face a higher bill for European carbon credits under plans outlined this month to reduce free permits for the sector.\n\nEU officials have also signalled likely moves to end a tax exemption for jet fuel enshrined in international treaties, a process that could take several years.\n\nGermany, which has pushed ahead with an airline tax increase to fund cheaper rail travel, plans binding minimum quotas for carbon-neutral alternative jet fuel.\n\nFar from giving struggling airlines a break, campaign groups are urging governments to use bailouts to force faster progress.\n\n“Airlines’ reliance on governments strengthens the case for acting to cut their emissions,” said Andrew Murphy of Brussels-based Transport & Environment.\n\nAssuming a slow recovery, the group says CORSIA’s market mechanism would price emissions as low as 17 cents per long-haul flight, leaving little incentive to curb greenhouse gases. ICAO, the U.N. aviation agency that developed the programme, said in a tweet it had been “misrepresented” by Transport & Environment.\n\nNOT FARE\n\nOther emissions-cutting proposals may divide the industry.\n\nAir France-KLM’s Smith called on French ministers to consider a minimum fare instead of taxes, citing the 40-euro minimum recently introduced in Austria. “Let’s discuss that,” he said in a newspaper interview.\n\nWhile minimum fares can curb overall traffic and emissions without hurting traditional airlines’ profits or jobs, they punish budget carriers and their customers.\n\n\"This is another mad idea from a high-fare airline that can only survive with over 10 billion euros of illegal state subsidies,\" Ryanair RYA.I said. The low-cost giant is challenging rivals' EU-approved bailouts in court.\n\n“Ordinary consumers all over Europe have benefited from and will continue to demand low fares, choice and competition,” it said.\n\nHowever these tensions play out, airlines face a rising tide of carbon costs on top of their current woes.\n\nMaintaining fuel tax exemptions would present a “flagrant inconsistency” with EU climate goals, said Christian Egenhofer of Brussels-based think tank CEPS.\n\nTaxing fuel would be an important step even if rates started low, Egenhofer said. “You know what happens with taxes – they always go up.”\n\n($1 = 0.8554 euros)",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “catastrophic” biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nWith the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.\n\n“We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.”\n\nWithout action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.\n\nScientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge.\n\nWhile Monday’s pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.\n\n“We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,” Canada’s Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.\n\nACTION PLEDGE\n\nIn England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.\n\nHowever, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: “It’s great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there’s no funding.”\n\nThe EU’s executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.\n\nBut so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.\n\nSeparately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.\n\nThe pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases.",

  "text": "NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - India reported on Monday that novel coronavirus infections had topped 6 million, nowhere near the number required for herd immunity in country of 1.3 billion people, and raising anxiety going into the peak period for Hindu religious festivals.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nIndia added a million cases in just 11 days, according to a Reuters tally of government data, and it has the second-highest number of infections, behind the United States which crossed 7 million last week.\n\nIndia’s festival season, which climaxes in October and November with the popular Hindu celebrations of Dussehra and Diwali, poses additional challenges, as officials try to dampen the usual large public celebrations and cross-country travel.\n\nTypically the festival season brings a big increase in consumer spending, and the more sombre atmosphere this year will further dampen an economy that contracted by almost a quarter in the three months to June - the worst figure on record.\n\nThe government in the western state of Gujarat said it will not hold an event to mark the nine-day Navratri festival due to begin on Oct. 17.\n\n“Navratri celebrations means business for garba (dance) classes, venues, decorators, food and water suppliers, orchestras, security agencies, sound system suppliers, dress and artificial jewellery sellers,” Samir Shah, director of Gujarat-based Archie Events told Reuters.\n\n“The economic impact is huge for everyone involved.”\n\nMajor cities in the state like Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara have dozens of large private events every year, that organisers say are almost certain to be cancelled.\n\nIn normal times, thousands of people would attend these gatherings every day during the festival, and Shah said that one major dance event would give temporary employment for at least 250 to 300 people.\n\nHealth ministry data on Monday showed there were 82,170 new infections in the last 24 hours. The daily death toll was 1,039, bringing the total number of victims to 95,542, the ministry said.\n\nWhile daily cases are down slightly from a peak hit earlier this month, the federal government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indians to remain on guard, with the country’s often-fragile healthcare system struggling to handle the rising number of cases.\n\n“We are far from having achieved any kind of herd immunity, which necessitates that all of us should continue following COVID-appropriate behaviour,” India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told his social media followers in a broadcast on Sunday.",

  "text": "ST. HELENA, Calif. (Reuters) - A wind-driven wildfire erupted on Sunday in the heart of northern California’s Napa Valley wine country to spread across nearly 2,000 acres (809 hectares), forcing the evacuation of a hospital and hundreds of homes, authorities said.\n\nFire crews were out in force, scrambling to fend off flames threatening neighborhoods and vineyards at the northern end of the famed wine-growing valley and surrounding hillsides, about 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco.\n\nThe blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, broke out before dawn near Calistoga and raced toward the adjacent communities of Deer Park and St. Helena, with flames reaching within a mile of the Adventist Health St. Helena hospital.\n\nAll 55 patients there at the time were safely evacuated by ambulance and helicopter over the course of five hours from about 7 a.m., hospital spokeswoman Linda Williams told Reuters.\n\n“We had ambulances lined up from all over the Bay area,” she said, adding that although smoke shrouded the facility, the skies above were clear enough for helicopters’ airlift efforts.\n\nIt was the second wildfire-related evacuation of the 151-bed hospital in a month, after a massive cluster of lightning-sparked blazes that swept several counties north of the San Francisco Bay region in August.\n\nAuthorities ordered about 600 homes evacuated on Sunday, with residents of 1,400 more warned to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice, said Tyree Zander, a spokesman for the state’s forestry and fire protection department (CalFire). The notices affected at least 5,000 people, he added.\n\nBy evening, flames stoked by winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph) had scorched about 1,800 acres (728 hectares) of grassy rolling hillsides and oak woodlands, with little or no containment, Zander said.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nFIRE AT HARVEST TIME\n\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but a Reuters photographer in St. Helena saw some structures that had been burned.\n\nThe blaze erupted midway through the traditional grape-harvesting period in the Napa Valley, world renowned as one of California’s premiere wine-producing regions. The area’s 475 wineries account for just 4% of the state’s total annual grape harvest but half of the retail value of all California wines sold, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.\n\nOf Napa’s 16 wine-growing districts, or sub-appellations, the Howell Mountain area may have faced the greatest threat, said Lisa Covey, a spokeswoman for Hall Family Wines, which kept open during the day all its three tasting rooms in the county.\n\nNapa and other wine-growing regions have been hit by wildfires in and around the Bay area for several years. Susan Krausz, co-owner of Arkenstone Estate Vineyards in the Howell Mountain community of Angwin, said it would take days or weeks to assess the impact of the latest blaze on valley vintners.\n\n“Most people have harvested,” she said, but added, “Any time’s a bad time for a fire.”\n\nTom Kaljian, 78, a realtor who owns a house about halfway between Calistoga and St. Helena, defied evacuation orders to spend the day with his wife hosing down their home and dry brush along a fence line separating their property from the Silverado Trail, a key north-south roadway.\n\n“We were told to get out of here, but I was trying to protect our little abode, so we stayed,” he told Reuters by telephone.\n\nAfter firefighters told him the house was no longer in danger, he added, “I stopped watering at that point, and came in and took a nap.”\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nThe Glass Fire came as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it was temporarily halting power to transmission lines in parts of 16 counties across northern and central California to guard against greater wildfire risks in hot, windy, dry weather.\n\nThe public safety power shutoffs were expected to affect about 65,000 regional homes and businesses, said PG&E, the state’s largest electric utility.\n\nA red flag warning for extreme wildfire risks for Napa Valley would run through Monday morning, Zander said.\n\nCalFire said a fire weather watch would start on Monday across much of Southern California, following the forecast return of hot, gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidity.\n\nCalifornia wildfires have scorched more than 3.7 million acres in the first nine months of 2020, far exceeding any single year in state history, killing 26 people and destroying more than 7,000 structures.",

  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Big Hit Entertainment, the management label of hugely popular South Korean K-Pop group BTS, priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its range on Monday, as hopeful buyers chased South Korea’s largest listing in three years.\n\nInstitutional investors expressed interest in more than 1,000 times the number of shares on offer, with Big Hit riding on the success of the seven-member band, which has become the first South Korean group to reach No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with song “Dynamite”.\n\nAn army of retail investors, known in South Korea as Ants, is also clamouring to buy stock, while die-hard BTS fans are bidding in hopes of securing even one share in what analysts expect to the country’ hottest listing this year.\n\nBig Hit priced the IPO at 135,000 won ($115) per share, it said in a regulatory filing, the top of an indicative price range of 105,000-135,000 won announced earlier this month.\n\nSome 1,420 institutional investors sought shares in pre-subscription offers, looking for 1,117 times the number available, the filing said. About 98% said they would pay the top-range price or more.\n\n“Big Hit is classified as a kind of global export firm,” said Park Sung-ho, analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.\n\n“Not only has it proven its ability to use Youtube, social media for smart market infiltration, it has fandom platform Weverse which gives unprecedented clarity and control over its revenue sources for a label, and may grow into a true platform player as outside artists increasingly join.”\n\nBig Hit reported a 49.7 billion won ($42.4 million) profit for the first half of 2020 as its online concert and merchandise sales on the Weverse app more than offset event cancellations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe IPO will make the seven BTS members multimillionaire stockholders, as Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk in August gave them 68,385 shares each, worth nearly $7.9 million at the issue price.\n\nThe firm will raise 962.6 billion won ($820 million) through the offer of 7.13 million new shares, the biggest South Korean IPO since Celltrion Healthcare raised 1 trillion won in 2017.\n\nThe pricing values Big Hit at about 4.8 trillion won, taking into account common shares plus redeemable preferred shares that will be converted into common shares upon the IPO.\n\nWith plenty of liquidity in the market, some analysts predict gross bids from retail investors could hit 100 trillion won ($85 billion).\n\nThe central bank is watching the offer closely as a massive oversubscription for shares could send ripples through short-term money markets.\n\nInstitutional and retail investors’ subscriptions are due on Oct. 5-6 and Big Hit is expected to list on the KOSPI on Oct. 15.\n\n($1 = 1,173.0400 won)",

REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nChina has ramped up efforts to get international groups and companies to refer on their websites and in official documents to democratic, self-ruled Taiwan as being part of China, to the ire of Taiwan’s government and many of its people.\n\nOver the weekend, Taiwan officials expressed anger after the Brussels-based Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy began listing on its website its six Taiwan member cites as belonging to China.\n\nThe mayors of the cities then wrote an open letter calling for the decision to be reversed.\n\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said after the protest, the group had reverted to its original designation of the cities as being part of Chinese Taipei, a name Taiwan uses in some international bodies like the Olympics to avoid Beijing’s objections to its participation.\n\nThe European Union “helped us in this effort”, Wu told parliament, without giving details.\n\n“We are very happy that with everyone’s hard work the name has reverted,” he said.\n\n“Though some people may not be happy with this name, at least the way we participate is not placed under another country.”\n\nThe Global Covenant, in a short statement, blamed a “technical glitch in the database” for the designation change, which it said had now been corrected.\n\nThe European Commission said it was “made aware of this issue over the weekend”, and referred to the Global Covenant’s statement about a technical glitch.\n\nNo EU member states have diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the EU itself tends to keep a low profile when it comes to Taiwan, wary of upsetting China, its second largest trading partner.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\n\n“Cities in the Taiwan region certainly should be listed as Chinese,” he told reporters.",

China Daily via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nPresident Xi Jinping and other leaders are expected to discuss and approve China’s economic and social development blueprint for 2021-2025 at a key Communist Party conclave in October, the sources told Reuters.\n\nState news agency Xinhua said on Monday the meeting will be held from Oct. 26-29.\n\nPolicymakers believe that setting a five-year growth target is vital for steering the world’s second-largest economy past the ‘middle income trap’, the sources said, after internal debate over whether it should abandon such targets to enable more flexibility.\n\nThe target also keeps local governments focused on development goals at a time of a deepening rift between China and the United States over a broad range of issues, they said.\n\n“There will be an economic target. Where is the direction of development if there is no such anchor?” said one source who is involved in the debate.\n\nGovernment think tanks and economists have made recommendations for average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets including “around 5%”, 5-5.5% to 5-6%, the sources said.\n\nChina is targeting average annual growth of over 6.5% for the 13th five-year plan that ends this year.\n\nChina’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome government advisers have argued that China should do away with official growth targets - a legacy of decades of central economic planning - to reduce reliance on debt-fueled stimulus and encourage more productive investment.\n\nReform advocates hope President Xi’s proposed “dual circulation” strategy, expected to be the centrepiece at the conclave, is an opportunity to quicken reforms to spur domestic demand and unleash fresh growth engines.\n\nIn May, China abandoned its annual GDP growth target, for 2020, for the first time in 18 years due to a heavy blow from the coronavirus crisis, although some economists suspected the government has maintained an implicit goal of around 3%.\n\nThe five-year plan is expected to be unveiled at the annual parliament meeting in early 2021. A growth target for 2021 itself, also to be unveiled at the parliament session, is likely to be set by top leaders at an annual economic conference in December.\n\n“We expect the government to either not set an explicit growth target or set a lower and more flexible (e.g., around 5%) growth target” for 2021-2025, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients.\n\n‘CRITICAL PERIOD’\n\nChina faces growing headwinds to maintain its ascent as the United States ratchets up pressure on trade, technology and other fronts, threatening a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies.\n\nAnnual growth of about 5% would be enough for China to bypass the “middle income trap” that has befallen countries such as Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, which have struggled to boost productivity and shift towards higher value-added industries.\n\nThe World Bank defines high-income countries as those with per capita gross national income (GNI) of above $12,535. China’s per capita income reached $10,410 in 2019, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe State Council’s Development Research Centre, the cabinet’s think tank, said in a recent report that it expects China to become a high income nation by 2024 and overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2032.\n\n“The 14th five-year plan period will be a critical period for China to deal with frictions with the United States and make strategic arrangements,” the think tank said in the report.\n\nAnalysts expect China’s GDP to grow 2-3% in 2020, the weakest since 1976, but growth could rebound to over 7% in 2021 thanks to a lower base, but the longer term trend is for slower growth as the population ages and the economy matures.",

The most impacted countries are the populous ones,” PVM analyst Tamas Varga said.\n\n“The speed with which the virus is spreading is the main concern for both health officials and financial investors.”\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that the global oil market has been stable for the past few months and the demand-supply balance restored, but warned of the risks of a second wave of COVID-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile one of the heaviest clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 2016 broke out over the weekend, reigniting concern about stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nDespite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies to limit output, more crude is being exported from OPEC producers Iran and Libya.\n\nOPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that commercial oil inventories in OECD countries are expected to stand only slightly above the five-year average in the first quarter of 2021, before falling below that level for the rest of the year.\n\nA factor that may offer some support to the market is the prospect of industrial action in Norway, where a workers’ strike that may take place on Sept. 30 is threatening to cut its production by 900,000 barrels per day, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (NOG) said on Friday.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain both said a post-Brexit deal was still some way off and differences persisted on Monday over putting in place their earlier divorce deal as they began a decisive week of talks in Brussels.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nBritain left the EU last January and is locked in negotiations on a new trade deal from 2021, as well as on implementing the divorce, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, especially on the sensitive Irish border.\n\nEU national leaders will assess the state of play at a summit next month, with a no-deal Brexit still possible.\n\nNegotiations have stumbled over fisheries, fair competition and settling disputes, and Brexit descended into fresh chaos this month when London proposed draft laws that would undermine the earlier agreement.\n\n“The UK’s positions are far apart from what the EU can accept, a deputy head of the bloc’s executive Commission, Maros Sefcovic, said on Monday after talks with Michael Gove, the minister handling the divorce deal.\n\n“We maintain that the bill, if adopted in its current form, would constitute an extremely serious violation of ... the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law,” he said, urging speedy progress before he meets Gove again in mid-October.\n\nGove said the clauses of the Internal Market Bill that undercut the Withdrawal Treaty would remain.\n\n“We want to make sure that the Withdrawal Agreement is implemented in full,” Gove told reporters. “But those clauses are there, they’re in legislation ... And those clauses will remain in that bill.”\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said in London that Britain’s focus was on progress in trade talks.\n\n“Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,” he said.\n\n“We simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.”\n\nTrade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy links and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far.\n\nEU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more talks before their next summit on Oct. 15-16. They will then assess whether to try push a deal over the line or prepare for the most damaging Brexit at the end of the year.\n\nThe EU says negotiators must seal an agreement by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments in the EU so that it can take effect from 2021 when Britain’s standstill transition ends after Brexit.\n\nOtherwise, the delicate peace on the island of Ireland as well as an estimated trillion euros worth of annual EU-UK trade would be at risk as the sides would fall back on general World Trade Organization rules that include tariffs and quotas.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium August 21, 2020. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nThe proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.\n\nWarsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.\n\nIn the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.\n\n“The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,” reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nBut the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders’ summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber.\n\nLiberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber’s work on the matter, said Berlin was “cuddling” with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest.\n\n“Without an automatic sanction system, Germany’s proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,” he told Reuters when asked about the scheme.\n\nAccording to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU’s executive European Commission.\n\nThis could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary.\n\nBut those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law.\n\nThat formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.\n\n“FINGER-WAGGING”\n\nSome have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.\n\n“It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn’t find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,” said one official working on the matter.\n\nGermany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc’s next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021.\n\nAsked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.\n\n“There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn’t like our government,” he told reporters.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.8568 euros)",

Pupils under six “could be frightened by his appearance”, the spokesman said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. “I’m a primary school teacher ... I love my job.”\n\nHe said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an “existential crisis”. Since then, he said, “Getting tattoos is my passion.”\n\nHe said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. “Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,” he said.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, and she pledged to become a justice in the mold of the late staunch conservative Antonin Scalia, setting another milestone in Trump’s rightward shift of the top U.S. judicial body.\n\nTrump’s announcement during a flag-festooned White House Rose Garden ceremony - with Barrett, 48, by his side and her seven children on hand - sets off a scramble by Senate Republicans to confirm her as the president has requested before Election Day in 5-1/2 weeks, when he will be seeking a second term in office.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at age 87 on Sept. 18, Barrett would become the fifth woman ever to serve on the court and would push its conservative majority to a commanding 6-3.\n\nLike Trump’s two other appointees, Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, Barrett is young enough that she could serve for decades in the lifetime job, leaving a lasting conservative imprint. Barrett is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since conservative Clarence Thomas was 43 in 1991.\n\nScalia, who died in 2016, was one of the most influential conservative justices in recent history. Barrett previously served as a clerk for Scalia on the high court and described him as her mentor, citing his “incalculable influence” on her life.\n\n“His judicial philosophy is mine too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers,” Barrett said.\n\nOn the court, Scalia voted to curb abortion rights, dissented when the court legalized gay marriage - he called it a “judicial putsch” - and backed broad gun rights, among other positions.\n\nWith Trump’s fellow Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, confirmation appears certain, although Democrats may try to make it as difficult as possible.\n\nAn emboldened Supreme Court conservative majority could shift the United States to the right on hot-button issues by, among other things, curbing abortion rights, expanding religious rights, striking down gun control laws, halting the expansion of LGBT rights, and endorsing new restrictions on voting rights.\n\nBarrett, a devout Roman Catholic who earned her law degree and taught at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, was appointed by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 and is a favorite of religious conservatives, a key Trump voter bloc.\n\n“Today it is my honor to nominate one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said Barrett would be the first mother of school-age children ever on the court. Along with her lawyer husband, her children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, were in the audience.\n\nLater on Saturday evening, the president drew loud cheers from thousands of supporters at a campaign rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania, when he called Barrett “an extraordinary scholar” who would defend their “God-given rights and freedoms.”\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“She should be running for president,” he said, comparing her academic record to that of his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nBarrett also praised Ginsburg, saying the late justice was “a woman of enormous talent and consequence” and mentioned Ginsburg’s long friendship with Scalia.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nMOVING AHEAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement praising Barrett and pledging to move forward quickly with the confirmation process. But Biden repeated his call for the appointment to be made by the winner of the Nov. 3 election.\n\n“The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress,” Biden said.\n\nDemocrats are still furious over McConnell’s 2016 refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland because it came during an election year. This marks the first time since 1956 that a U.S. president has moved to fill a Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\n\nFormer presidential candidate and senator Bernie Sanders called Republican efforts to push through the nomination “an absolute outrage” and said Americans should fight “as hard as we can to ensure that this nominee is not confirmed.”\n\nBarrett is expected to begin traditional courtesy calls on individual senators on Tuesday. Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings will begin Oct. 12, Trump said.\n\nDemocrats are set to make the fate of the Obamacare healthcare law a key part of the confirmation fight.\n\nBarrett could be on the bench for the court’s Nov. 10 oral arguments in a case in which Trump and fellow Republicans are seeking to invalidate the 2010 law, formally called the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Justice Ginsburg must be turning over in her grave up in heaven,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said, “to see that the person they chose seems to be intent on undoing all the things that Ginsburg did.”",

  "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects across markets, and investors are already trying to identify potential winners and losers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers a speech on the U.S. Supreme Court at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., September 27, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBroadly speaking, analysts say Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes could pressure company earnings. But they expect him to support infrastructure projects and renewable energy.\n\nA second Trump term, meanwhile, may bring more tax cuts and extend de-regulation that could benefit the energy and financial sectors, while risking continued tensions with China.\n\nWith the Senate majority also at stake, the election could allow one party to control the presidency and Congress, making it easier to enact legislation such as the additional fiscal stimulus currently being held up in a political standoff.\n\nHere is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:\n\nBIDEN BASKET\n\nALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A stronger expected “green energy” push under a Biden administration could support alternative energy stocks. For example, tax credit extensions would provide a boost for solar stocks such as Sunnova Energy International, SunPower Corp and Enphase Energy, according to Credit Suisse.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES: Tesla shares already have had a mammoth run during the Trump administration, but some believe a Biden presidency could further fuel the electric vehicle company’s shares.\n\n“Biden has proposed new tax incentives, government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs in particular,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in a report.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nOther potential winners from a Biden victory would be auto suppliers focused on electrification and green, emission-free technologies, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner and Visteon, Nelson wrote.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE: A large infrastructure spending package “may be an early priority for a Biden administration as it seeks a bipartisan win,” according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nBiden’s plan would boost a broad group of engineering and construction companies, with AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group and MasTec among the biggest beneficiaries, according to Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz.\n\nTARIFF TRADE: A Biden administration could see a calming of the U.S.-China tariff war. “Should trade policy be less-focused on the use of tariffs, both importers and exporters may benefit,” according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nJP Morgan in a July report listed Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher and 3M among a number of stocks that could outperform should a Biden presidency lead to a “de-escalation” in U.S.-China tariff tensions.\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nTAX RELIEF: A Biden loss could spell additional relief for companies that benefited from the president’s corporate tax cuts.\n\nIn its July report, JP Morgan listed AT&T, Target and Waste Management among companies that benefited from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could underperform in a Biden presidency.\n\nBANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration, particularly if a progressive such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a high-profile role.\n\nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say a Trump win with Republicans retaining the Senate is the best election scenario for banks, noting “the Republican agenda of reduced regulation remains intact.” Stocks to own in that scenario include Wells Fargo and Citigroup, KBW wrote.\n\nDEFENSE: Trump would probably “succeed in maintaining large defense spending, despite a Democratic House, given the reality of great power struggle with China and Russia,” BCA Research strategists said in a recent report.\n\nFOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES: “Support for energy companies and specifically fossil fuels appears to be an ongoing objective for Trump,” according to LPL’s Detrick. He added that most companies in this sector, excluding those in renewable energy, will likely benefit from a Trump victory.",

  "text": "(Reuters) - Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden face off on Tuesday in a televised presidential debate, part of a 60-year-old tradition marked by some of the most memorable moments of modern U.S. political history:\n\nSlideshow ( 13 images )\n\n- 1960: The first televised debate pitted Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o’clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.\n\n- 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.” Carter won the election.\n\n- 1980: Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who already had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: “There you go again” and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election.\n\n- 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: “I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” Reagan was re-elected.\n\n- 1988: A debate against Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed “the iceman” by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Bush won the election.\n\nThe vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Bush’s running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.”\n\n- 1992: Three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Clinton won the election.\n\n- 1996: In a debate with Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: “I can only tell you that I don’t think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It’s the age of his ideas that I question.” Clinton was re-elected.\n\n- 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W. Bush, Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. “We all make mistakes. I’ve been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,” Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing “syllable.” Bush won the election.\n\n- 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.\n\n- 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain’s running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: “Aw, say it ain’t so, Joe,” adding a “doggone it” for good measure. Biden and Palin both vowed to make U.S. economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Biden said McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election.\n\n- 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had “binders full of women” as candidates for Cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Romney. Obama won again.\n\n- 2016: The first debate between Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Clinton jabbing at Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate’s husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage and she wondered if she should have told him to “back up, you creep.” Instead she said, “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” In the third debate Trump called Clinton “such a nasty woman” and declined to say he would accept the election results.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden square off on Tuesday in their first presidential debate. With five weeks to go until the Nov. 3 general election, the stakes are high.\n\nMembers of the news media arrive in the hall ahead of the first presidential debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S., September 28, 2020. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nHere are five things to watch for during the 90-minute televised debate in Cleveland:\n\nFLASHPOINTS\n\nThe face-to-face match-up comes after the New York Times revealed that Trump, a wealthy former businessman and reality television star, paid only $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017.\n\nThe report, which Trump called “total fake news,” gives Biden a fresh opening to make his case that his working-class roots better position him to understand the economic struggles of everyday Americans than the billionaire occupying the White House.\n\nTrump also faced persistent questions, based on his statements about a rigged election, about whether he will accept the voting results should he lose. With millions at home watching, how will he respond if Biden pushes him to commit to a peaceful transfer of power?\n\nBoth candidates will scuffle over Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump is using his pick to rally his conservative voter base and distract from his record on the coronavirus and other matters, while Biden is warning of threats to health care and abortion rights.\n\nBIDEN’S MOMENT\n\nFor Biden, the debate will serve as sort of a reintroduction. While he has held limited events in some states and given media interviews, the coronavirus pandemic has largely rendered him off stage for months.\n\nThat has allowed Biden to keep the focus where he wants it: on Trump and his performance in office. But on Tuesday, the Democratic nominee will have to make his own case for the presidency, while giving concise answers and avoiding some of the verbal mishaps that have plagued him throughout his political career.\n\nWith Biden leading in polls, a strong outing could place Trump in even worse shape. A weak one could reshape the race.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nOWNING IT\n\nFaced with alarming coronavirus statistics or unrest in the streets, Trump is quick to blame Democratic officials, activists, scientists – anybody but him. One of Biden’s goals will be making sure the public understands that Trump is the one in charge.\n\nTrump could use his office to his advantage, as he often tries to do with the economy. Voters like to see a president take responsibility – for the good and the bad.\n\nJohn Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, wonders if Trump will react poorly to sharp or unfriendly queries from moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. “Will Trump have a tough time answering non-softball questions?” Geer said.\n\nTWISTING THE TRUTH\n\nAs Trump’s campaign rallies show, he can fire off falsehoods in machine-gun fashion. Examples include the Republican’s common claim that the U.S. economy was operating at historic levels before the pandemic (it wasn’t) and that the virus has largely dissipated (it hasn’t).\n\nAttempting to constantly pin Trump to the truth could turn Biden into a real-time fact-checker - possibly to the Democrat’s detriment.\n\n“It’s a big mistake to try and do that,” said Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan. “You have to focus on your own agenda.”\n\nDOWN IN THE MUD\n\nBiden has worried aloud about reacting to Trump’s propensity for ad hominem attacks. On the campaign trail, the former vice president has sometimes shown flashes of temper, getting his “Irish up” as he calls it.\n\nTrump in a tweet on Sunday went as far as to suggest Biden will be on performance-enhancing drugs during the debate, signaling that perhaps there is little he will not do or say to rattle Biden and disrupt the proceedings.\n\nPolls show that Trump’s frequent questioning of the 77-year-old Biden’s mental fitness has registered with some voters. Trump’s team will be looking for moments where Biden seems flustered or unsure to exploit as viral video.\n\n“If the president lies, call it a lie. If he attacks Biden personally, just shrug it off and not get personal,” Geer said. “Biden needs to continue to be presidential and tough, even if there is some mud on his suit jacket.”",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing tax-return data.\n\nIn a report that Trump dismissed as “fake news,” the Times said the Republican president also paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017, despite receiving $427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.\n\nThe disclosure of previously private tax information came little more than a month before the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Democrats were quick to seize on the report to paint Trump as a tax dodger and raise questions about his carefully groomed image as a savvy businessman.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to ask Americans to raise their hands if they paid more in federal income tax than Trump.\n\nCalling the report “total fake news” at a White House news conference, Trump again cited an ongoing audit as his reason for not releasing his returns. In a statement to the Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said Trump had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade, without weighing in on the specific finding of minimal income taxes.\n\nTrump’s consistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates. He is currently in a legal battle with New York City prosecutors and congressional Democrats who are seeking to obtain his returns.\n\nHe also previously indicated he preferred to minimize his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him “smart.”\n\nThe Times reported that Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire. It said he claimed $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite saying he had income of at least $434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.\n\nThe Times emphasized the documents reveal only what Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth.\n\nThe Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization. It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.\n\nThe Times also reported that Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service audit over a $72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him in that audit, he could have to pay over $100 million, according to the newspaper.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, will begin meeting with senators this week as Republicans push ahead with a rapid Senate confirmation process ahead of November’s presidential election over the objections of Democrats.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett stands as U.S President Donald Trump holds an event to announce her as his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18, at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nTrump on Saturday announced Barrett, 48, as his selection to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 at age 87. Barrett, who would be the fifth woman to serve on the high court, said she would be a justice in the mold of the late staunch conservative Antonin Scalia.\n\nHer confirmation by the Senate would result in a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate and are aiming to hold a vote before the Nov. 3 election, in accordance with Trump’s wishes.\n\nTrump, who is running for a second term against Democrat Joe Biden, has said he wants nine justices on the court so that it will have a full complement to tackle any election-related legal issues and possibly decide the outcome in his favor.\n\nThe only time in U.S. history the Supreme Court has had to resolve a presidential election was in 2000.\n\nBarrett is set to start meeting with senators ahead of a multi-day confirmation hearing scheduled to begin on Oct. 12, when she will face questions about her judicial philosophy and approach to the law.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the committee, told Fox News on Sunday that the panel will likely vote on the nomination on Oct. 22, setting up a final vote on the Senate floor by the end of the month.\n\nDemocrats object to Republicans pushing through the nomination so close to the election, saying that the winner of the contest should get to pick the nominee.\n\nTrump’s nomination of Barrett is the first time since 1956 that a U.S. president has moved to fill a Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\n\nDemocratic opposition to Barrett has so far been focused on her possible role as a deciding vote in a case before the Supreme Court in which Trump and fellow Republicans are asking the justices to strike down the Obamacare health law known formally as the Affordable Care Act. If confirmed quickly, Barrett could be on the bench when the justices hear oral arguments on Nov. 10.\n\nA key provision of the law that would be thrown out if the court struck it down requires insurance companies to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSome Democrats have said they will refuse to meet with Barrett but others, including some on the committee, have said they intend to engage in the process so they can ask Barrett directly about issues such as healthcare and abortion.\n\nConservative activists are hoping that a 6-3 conservative majority will move the court to the right by curbing abortion rights, expanding gun rights and upholding voting restrictions.\n\nDemocrats are likely to seek a pledge from Barrett that she would recuse herself if election-related issues reach the court next month.",

  "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. businesses with COVID-19 outbreaks are facing an emerging legal threat from claims that workers brought coronavirus home and infected relatives, which one risk analysis firm said could cost employers billions of dollars.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A volunteer places American flags representing some of the 200,000 lives lost in the United States in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the National Mall in Washington, U.S., September 22, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nThe daughter of Esperanza Ugalde of Illinois filed in August what lawyers believe is the first wrongful death “take home” lawsuit, alleging her mother died of COVID-19 that her father contracted at Aurora Packing Co’s meat processing plant.\n\nThe cases borrow elements from “take home” asbestos litigation and avoid caps on liability for workplace injuries, exposing business to costly pain and suffering damages, even though the plaintiff never set foot on their premises.\n\n“Businesses should be very concerned about these cases,” said labor and employment attorney Tom Gies of Crowell & Moring, which defends employers.\n\nThe lawsuit against Aurora alleges that Ricardo Ugalde worked “shoulder to shoulder” on the company’s processing line in April when Aurora knew it had a coronavirus outbreak at its facility and failed to warn employees or adopt any infection prevention measures.\n\nAurora did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBetween 7% and 9% of the roughly 200,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths so far are believed to stem from take-home infections and the lawsuits could cost businesses up to $21 billion if the number of Americans fatalities reaches 300,000, according to Praedicat, a firm that evaluates risks for insurers.\n\nRob Reville, Praedicat’s chief executive, cautions that is a worst-case scenario and said the cases might cost far less, depending on how judges view the lawsuits.\n\nThe U.S. workers compensation system generally makes it difficult for workers to sue for COVID-19. The system caps liability for businesses and bars costly lawsuits in return for quick payments to employees, who do not need to prove fault.\n\nBut Esperanza Ugalde was not an employee of Aurora, so her family can sue the company. Depending on the circumstances, a successful wrongful death case can top $1 million in damages.\n\nTake-home cases have been around for decades in asbestos litigation and courts have split on whether a business has an obligation to members of the public who have never been on their premises.\n\nIn 2013, a California jury awarded Rose-Marie Griggs $27.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages after she contracted mesothelioma that her lawyers argued was caused by asbestos fibers carried home in the 1950s on the work clothes of her then-husband, who installed insulation for an affiliate of Owens-Illinios Inc.\n\nThe company appealed and two sides reached a private settlement before the appeal was heard.\n\nCONTESTING THE ‘CAUSAL CHAIN’\n\nAttorneys for both plaintiffs and companies said successful cases require a strong “causal chain” linking the sick family member to the worker and then to the business and the business’s alleged failure to adopt safety measures.\n\nMiriam Alvarez Reynoso sued Byrne & Schaefer Inc, a manufacturer of electrical components in Lockport, Illinois, alleging negligence by the company led to her contracting COVID-19 and suffering “serious injuries to multiple organs.”\n\nReynoso’s lawsuit says she became infected while caring for her husband Servando Reynoso, a parts assembler at the company, who came home sick from work on April 8. It lists 18 categories of alleged shortcomings by Byrne & Schaefer, including failing to clean work areas and ignoring employees who said they had COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nCompany owner Tim Byrne said his five employees wore masks routinely before the pandemic to protect against dust and regularly used gloves.\n\n“He was sick before anyone else,” said Byrne. “It’s difficult to prove after the fact.”\n\nLawyers said employers would likely be reluctant to settle the cases for significant sums until claims were vetted in the court system.\n\nPeter Wozniak, an attorney with Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers, said the cases will test juror attitudes toward the behavior of plaintiffs, who need to show they protected themselves from other sources of infection.\n\n“Are you always wearing a mask?

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

REUTERS/Al Drago\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is rallying Democrats to prepare for a once-in-a-century election scenario requiring Congress to decide the outcome of the presidential race, if neither Democrat Joe Biden nor President Donald Trump wins outright.\n\nIn a campaign letter to colleagues, Pelosi told her fellow House Democrats that recent comments by Trump demonstrate that he could ask the House to decide the race if it is not clear which of the two had received the minimum 270 Electoral College votes in the Nov. 3 presidential election to gain office.\n\nTrump repeatedly has questioned the security of mail-in ballots, which could take a while to tabulate given the high number of voters likely to opt for using them this year.\n\nDemocrats fear that the president could attempt to have the count of those votes cut short in an attempt to have the election outcome determined by the House.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House would vote by state delegation to settle such a contest, with each state casting a single vote. While Democrats control the chamber by 232 seats to 198, Republicans control a majority of 26 state delegations, vs. 22 for Democrats. Pennsylvania’s delegation is tied, while Michigan has a 7-6 split between Democrats and Republicans and an additional seat held by a Libertarian.\n\nThe House has not determined the outcome of a presidential election since 1876.\n\nPelosi called on Democrats for “an all out effort” to capture additional Republican-held House seats, which they might need if a decision on the presidential election spills over into next year. She also urged Democrats to marshal resources to support the House Majority PAC, a political action committee committed to promoting Democratic candidates for the House.\n\n“Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats,” Pelosi wrote.\n\nHouse Republicans and their aides were not immediately available for comment. Like Democrats, they too have political operations aimed at expanding their numbers in the House.",

They said their son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nA couple of months later the school authorities informed him he would no longer teach kindergarten children, he said. “I think the decision they took was quite sad,” said Helaine.\n\nA spokesman for the local education authority said an agreement was reached with Helaine to move him away from teaching kindergarten. Pupils under six “could be frightened by his appearance”, the spokesman said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. “I’m a primary school teacher ... I love my job.”\n\nHe said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an “existential crisis”. Since then, he said, “Getting tattoos is my passion.”\n\nHe said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. “Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,” he said.",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium August 21, 2020. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nThe proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.\n\nWarsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.\n\nIn the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.\n\n“The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,” reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nBut the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders’ summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber.\n\nLiberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber’s work on the matter, said Berlin was “cuddling” with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest.\n\n“Without an automatic sanction system, Germany’s proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,” he told Reuters when asked about the scheme.\n\nAccording to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU’s executive European Commission.\n\nThis could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary.\n\nBut those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law.\n\nThat formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.\n\n“FINGER-WAGGING”\n\nSome have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.\n\n“It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn’t find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,” said one official working on the matter.\n\nGermany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc’s next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021.\n\nAsked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.\n\n“There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn’t like our government,” he told reporters.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.8568 euros)",

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

  "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey is sending Syrian rebel fighters to support Azerbaijan in its escalating conflict with neighbouring Armenia, two Syrian rebels have said, as Ankara pledges to step up backing for its majority-Muslim ally.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Azeri men living in Turkey wave flags of Turkey and Azerbaijan during a protest following clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in Istanbul, Turkey, July 19, 2020. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nThe clashes over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh are the heaviest since 2016, with reports of dozens of deaths and hundreds wounded.\n\nArmenia’s ambassador to Moscow said on Monday that Turkey had sent around 4,000 fighters from northern Syria to Azerbaijan and that they were fighting there, an assertion denied by an aide to Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev.\n\nArmenia also said Turkish military experts were fighting alongside Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous breakaway region of Azerbaijan run by ethnic Armenians, and that Turkey had provided drones and warplanes.\n\nAzerbaijan denied the reports. Turkey did not immediately comment, although senior officials including President Tayyip Erdogan, who has increasingly been flexing Turkey’s military muscle abroad, have promised support for Baku.\n\nThe two fighters, from Turkish-backed rebel groups in areas of northern Syria under Turkish control, said they were deploying to Azerbaijan in coordination with Ankara.\n\nThey declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Reuters could not independently verify their accounts.\n\n“I didn’t want to go, but I don’t have any money. Life is very hard and poor,” said a fighter who had fought in Syria for Ahrar al-Sham, a group that Turkey has supported.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\n$1,500 A MONTH\n\nBoth men said they had been told by their Syrian brigade commanders they would earn around $1,500 a month - a large wage for Syria, where the economy and currency have collapsed.\n\nThe fighter said he had arranged his assignment with an official from the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) in Afrin, a region of northwest Syria seized by Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies two years ago.\n\nA spokesman for the SNA, an umbrella group of Syrian rebel groups backed by Turkey, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other fighter, from the SNA-affiliated Jaish al-Nukhba militia, said he had been told nearly 1,000 Syrians were set to be deployed to Azerbaijan. Other rebels, who also declined to be named, gave figures of between 700 and 1,000.\n\nThe two men, who spoke to Reuters last week, said they expected to be despatched on Sept. 25, to guard facilities but not to fight. Reuters was not able to contact them on Monday to confirm their location.\n\nHikmat Hajiyev, a foreign policy aide to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said it was “complete nonsense” to say Syrian fighters were coming to help his country: “Our armed forces have more than enough personnel and reserve forces.”\n\nIn recent years, Turkey has projected growing power abroad with incursions into neighbouring Syria and Iraq, and military support for the internationally recognised government in Libya.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly said it is also ready to provide support to Azerbaijan, with which it has strong historical and cultural ties and runs joint energy projects.\n\nRIVALRY WITH RUSSIA\n\nDefence Minister Hulusi Akar attended joint military drills in Azerbaijan in August, and Erdogan used his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last week to accuse Armenia of attacking its neighbour.\n\nConcern that Turkey could get more involved in the conflict helped drag its currency to a record low against the dollar on Monday.\n\nMustafa Sejari, a senior Syrian rebel, did not confirm the deployment of fighters to Azerbaijan but said Turkey was the “only hope” left for opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken most rebel-held land in Syria with Russian and Iranian support.\n\n“Our alliance with (Turkey) takes different forms and is truly a common fate,” he said. “I don’t rule out at all Turkey becoming a strategic choice for Syrian youths.”\n\nTurkey has already used Syrian fighters to help block an assault on the Libyan capital Tripoli earlier this year by General Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, backed by Russia among others.\n\nTheir use in Syria would create a third theatre for Turkey’s regional rivalry with Moscow, which has a military base in Armenia, considers it a strategic partner in the South Caucasus, and supplies it with weapons. It has not commented on the reports of Syrian fighters being sent to Azerbaijan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was following the situation very closely and that the conflict had to be resolved through diplomacy.",

  "text": "PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM AIRF.PA is battling new green taxes on top of the coronavirus crisis - in a test of growing policy tensions between righting Europe's crippled airlines and delivering on climate goals.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The first Air France airliner's Airbus A350 takes off after a ceremony at the aircraft builder's headquarters in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe Franco-Dutch group, sustained by 10.4 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in state-backed loans, faces higher duties in both home markets as well as EU plans to hike airlines’ carbon costs.\n\nThe struggle unfolding around Air France-KLM is part of a larger reckoning for carbon-intensive industries as efforts to tackle global warming spawn more taxes and regulation.\n\nWhile campaigners say those are long overdue, crisis-hit airlines warn their timing and severity will cost thousands more jobs and hurt development of lower-carbon technologies.\n\nNew taxes “do not support emissions reductions”, said Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith in response to proposed increases to French passenger duties.\n\n“In fact it’s counterproductive and would deprive us of finances that could otherwise be invested in environmental projects,” he told an online industry forum this month.\n\nTensions can only rise as emissions goals are toughened to slow dangerous climate change. The European Union’s executive now wants to cut greenhouse gas output by 55% in the next decade rather than the previous 40%, from a 1990 baseline.\n\nWhile the pandemic has dampened climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, their political legacy must be squared with the economic emergency.\n\nGREEN WAVE\n\nFrench municipal elections saw the ecologist EELV party take Lyon, Bordeaux and Strasbourg in a June 28 “Green Wave”. The next day, President Emmanuel Macron promised to advance 146 proposals from a “citizens’ climate convention”.\n\nThose include an airline duty increase to 30 euros per short-haul economy passenger and 400 euros for long-haul business, from their current 1.50-18 euro range. At 2019 traffic, officials say the sector would pay 4.2 billion euros.\n\nKey members of the government, which underwrote 7 billion euros for Air France, are backing away from the pledge as officials draft legislation in response to the convention.\n\n“It would be grotesque to take back with one hand what we’d given the sector with the other,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told daily Les Echos.\n\nLe Maire and his Dutch counterpart were among nine EU finance ministers who had called for “taxation or similar policies” to curb emissions by raising air fares.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, the Netherlands is introducing passenger duties worth 220 million euros at pre-crisis traffic. A Greenpeace legal challenge is also demanding steeper emissions cuts in return for KLM’s 3.4 billion-euro aid package.\n\nOFFSETS UPSET\n\nAirline emissions account for 2.5% of the global total but are set to triple by 2050. Under a U.N.-brokered programme, CORSIA, the industry aims to counter emissions growth from international flights with carbon offsets, whose effects are contested.\n\nAirbus AIR.PA has given itself until 2035 to put a \"zero-emission\" plane into service, but many are sceptical about that deadline. Synthetic fuels are also too scarce and expensive to offer a near-term solution.\n\nFor intra-European flights, airlines would face a higher bill for European carbon credits under plans outlined this month to reduce free permits for the sector.\n\nEU officials have also signalled likely moves to end a tax exemption for jet fuel enshrined in international treaties, a process that could take several years.\n\nGermany, which has pushed ahead with an airline tax increase to fund cheaper rail travel, plans binding minimum quotas for carbon-neutral alternative jet fuel.\n\nFar from giving struggling airlines a break, campaign groups are urging governments to use bailouts to force faster progress.\n\n“Airlines’ reliance on governments strengthens the case for acting to cut their emissions,” said Andrew Murphy of Brussels-based Transport & Environment.\n\nAssuming a slow recovery, the group says CORSIA’s market mechanism would price emissions as low as 17 cents per long-haul flight, leaving little incentive to curb greenhouse gases. ICAO, the U.N. aviation agency that developed the programme, said in a tweet it had been “misrepresented” by Transport & Environment.\n\nNOT FARE\n\nOther emissions-cutting proposals may divide the industry.\n\nAir France-KLM’s Smith called on French ministers to consider a minimum fare instead of taxes, citing the 40-euro minimum recently introduced in Austria. “Let’s discuss that,” he said in a newspaper interview.\n\nWhile minimum fares can curb overall traffic and emissions without hurting traditional airlines’ profits or jobs, they punish budget carriers and their customers.\n\n\"This is another mad idea from a high-fare airline that can only survive with over 10 billion euros of illegal state subsidies,\" Ryanair RYA.I said. The low-cost giant is challenging rivals' EU-approved bailouts in court.\n\n“Ordinary consumers all over Europe have benefited from and will continue to demand low fares, choice and competition,” it said.\n\nHowever these tensions play out, airlines face a rising tide of carbon costs on top of their current woes.\n\nMaintaining fuel tax exemptions would present a “flagrant inconsistency” with EU climate goals, said Christian Egenhofer of Brussels-based think tank CEPS.\n\nTaxing fuel would be an important step even if rates started low, Egenhofer said. “You know what happens with taxes – they always go up.”\n\n($1 = 0.8554 euros)",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “catastrophic” biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nWith the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.\n\n“We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\n\n“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.”\n\nWithout action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.\n\nScientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge.\n\nWhile Monday’s pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.\n\n“We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,” Canada’s Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.\n\nACTION PLEDGE\n\nIn England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.\n\nHowever, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: “It’s great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there’s no funding.”\n\nThe EU’s executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.\n\nBut so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.\n\nSeparately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.\n\nThe pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases.",

  "text": "NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - India reported on Monday that novel coronavirus infections had topped 6 million, nowhere near the number required for herd immunity in country of 1.3 billion people, and raising anxiety going into the peak period for Hindu religious festivals.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nIndia added a million cases in just 11 days, according to a Reuters tally of government data, and it has the second-highest number of infections, behind the United States which crossed 7 million last week.\n\nIndia’s festival season, which climaxes in October and November with the popular Hindu celebrations of Dussehra and Diwali, poses additional challenges, as officials try to dampen the usual large public celebrations and cross-country travel.\n\nTypically the festival season brings a big increase in consumer spending, and the more sombre atmosphere this year will further dampen an economy that contracted by almost a quarter in the three months to June - the worst figure on record.\n\nThe government in the western state of Gujarat said it will not hold an event to mark the nine-day Navratri festival due to begin on Oct. 17.\n\n“Navratri celebrations means business for garba (dance) classes, venues, decorators, food and water suppliers, orchestras, security agencies, sound system suppliers, dress and artificial jewellery sellers,” Samir Shah, director of Gujarat-based Archie Events told Reuters.\n\n“The economic impact is huge for everyone involved.”\n\nMajor cities in the state like Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara have dozens of large private events every year, that organisers say are almost certain to be cancelled.\n\nIn normal times, thousands of people would attend these gatherings every day during the festival, and Shah said that one major dance event would give temporary employment for at least 250 to 300 people.\n\nHealth ministry data on Monday showed there were 82,170 new infections in the last 24 hours. The daily death toll was 1,039, bringing the total number of victims to 95,542, the ministry said.\n\nWhile daily cases are down slightly from a peak hit earlier this month, the federal government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indians to remain on guard, with the country’s often-fragile healthcare system struggling to handle the rising number of cases.\n\n“We are far from having achieved any kind of herd immunity, which necessitates that all of us should continue following COVID-appropriate behaviour,” India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told his social media followers in a broadcast on Sunday.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined “at this time” to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols’ detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it “will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.”\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump’s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his “blessing.”\n\nBut key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its “ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.”\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational”.\n\n“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on “bullying and extortion”.\n\nTrump’s administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.”\n\nAnother U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings’ WeChat from U.S. app stores.",

REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nChina has ramped up efforts to get international groups and companies to refer on their websites and in official documents to democratic, self-ruled Taiwan as being part of China, to the ire of Taiwan’s government and many of its people.\n\nOver the weekend, Taiwan officials expressed anger after the Brussels-based Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy began listing on its website its six Taiwan member cites as belonging to China.\n\nThe mayors of the cities then wrote an open letter calling for the decision to be reversed.\n\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said after the protest, the group had reverted to its original designation of the cities as being part of Chinese Taipei, a name Taiwan uses in some international bodies like the Olympics to avoid Beijing’s objections to its participation.\n\nThe European Union “helped us in this effort”, Wu told parliament, without giving details.\n\n“We are very happy that with everyone’s hard work the name has reverted,” he said.\n\n“Though some people may not be happy with this name, at least the way we participate is not placed under another country.”\n\nThe Global Covenant, in a short statement, blamed a “technical glitch in the database” for the designation change, which it said had now been corrected.\n\nThe European Commission said it was “made aware of this issue over the weekend”, and referred to the Global Covenant’s statement about a technical glitch.\n\nNo EU member states have diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the EU itself tends to keep a low profile when it comes to Taiwan, wary of upsetting China, its second largest trading partner.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\n\n“Cities in the Taiwan region certainly should be listed as Chinese,” he told reporters.",

  "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s leaders are poised to endorse a lower economic growth target for Beijing’s next five-year plan compared with 2016-2020, as authorities navigate growing challenges fuelled by a deepening rift with the United States, policy sources said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Workers wearing face masks following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak load steel products for export to a cargo ship at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China May 27, 2020. China Daily via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nPresident Xi Jinping and other leaders are expected to discuss and approve China’s economic and social development blueprint for 2021-2025 at a key Communist Party conclave in October, the sources told Reuters.\n\nState news agency Xinhua said on Monday the meeting will be held from Oct. 26-29.\n\nPolicymakers believe that setting a five-year growth target is vital for steering the world’s second-largest economy past the ‘middle income trap’, the sources said, after internal debate over whether it should abandon such targets to enable more flexibility.\n\nThe target also keeps local governments focused on development goals at a time of a deepening rift between China and the United States over a broad range of issues, they said.\n\n“There will be an economic target. Where is the direction of development if there is no such anchor?” said one source who is involved in the debate.\n\nGovernment think tanks and economists have made recommendations for average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets including “around 5%”, 5-5.5% to 5-6%, the sources said.\n\nChina is targeting average annual growth of over 6.5% for the 13th five-year plan that ends this year.\n\nChina’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome government advisers have argued that China should do away with official growth targets - a legacy of decades of central economic planning - to reduce reliance on debt-fueled stimulus and encourage more productive investment.\n\nReform advocates hope President Xi’s proposed “dual circulation” strategy, expected to be the centrepiece at the conclave, is an opportunity to quicken reforms to spur domestic demand and unleash fresh growth engines.\n\nIn May, China abandoned its annual GDP growth target, for 2020, for the first time in 18 years due to a heavy blow from the coronavirus crisis, although some economists suspected the government has maintained an implicit goal of around 3%.\n\nThe five-year plan is expected to be unveiled at the annual parliament meeting in early 2021. A growth target for 2021 itself, also to be unveiled at the parliament session, is likely to be set by top leaders at an annual economic conference in December.\n\n“We expect the government to either not set an explicit growth target or set a lower and more flexible (e.g., around 5%) growth target” for 2021-2025, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients.\n\n‘CRITICAL PERIOD’\n\nChina faces growing headwinds to maintain its ascent as the United States ratchets up pressure on trade, technology and other fronts, threatening a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies.\n\nAnnual growth of about 5% would be enough for China to bypass the “middle income trap” that has befallen countries such as Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, which have struggled to boost productivity and shift towards higher value-added industries.\n\nThe World Bank defines high-income countries as those with per capita gross national income (GNI) of above $12,535. China’s per capita income reached $10,410 in 2019, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe State Council’s Development Research Centre, the cabinet’s think tank, said in a recent report that it expects China to become a high income nation by 2024 and overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2032.\n\n“The 14th five-year plan period will be a critical period for China to deal with frictions with the United States and make strategic arrangements,” the think tank said in the report.\n\nAnalysts expect China’s GDP to grow 2-3% in 2020, the weakest since 1976, but growth could rebound to over 7% in 2021 thanks to a lower base, but the longer term trend is for slower growth as the population ages and the economy matures.",

Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain both said a post-Brexit deal was still some way off and differences persisted on Monday over putting in place their earlier divorce deal as they began a decisive week of talks in Brussels.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nBritain left the EU last January and is locked in negotiations on a new trade deal from 2021, as well as on implementing the divorce, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, especially on the sensitive Irish border.\n\nEU national leaders will assess the state of play at a summit next month, with a no-deal Brexit still possible.\n\nNegotiations have stumbled over fisheries, fair competition and settling disputes, and Brexit descended into fresh chaos this month when London proposed draft laws that would undermine the earlier agreement.\n\n“The UK’s positions are far apart from what the EU can accept, a deputy head of the bloc’s executive Commission, Maros Sefcovic, said on Monday after talks with Michael Gove, the minister handling the divorce deal.\n\n“We maintain that the bill, if adopted in its current form, would constitute an extremely serious violation of ... the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law,” he said, urging speedy progress before he meets Gove again in mid-October.\n\nGove said the clauses of the Internal Market Bill that undercut the Withdrawal Treaty would remain.\n\n“We want to make sure that the Withdrawal Agreement is implemented in full,” Gove told reporters. “But those clauses are there, they’re in legislation ... And those clauses will remain in that bill.”\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said in London that Britain’s focus was on progress in trade talks.\n\n“Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,” he said.\n\n“We simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.”\n\nTrade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy links and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far.\n\nEU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more talks before their next summit on Oct. 15-16. They will then assess whether to try push a deal over the line or prepare for the most damaging Brexit at the end of the year.\n\nThe EU says negotiators must seal an agreement by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments in the EU so that it can take effect from 2021 when Britain’s standstill transition ends after Brexit.\n\nOtherwise, the delicate peace on the island of Ireland as well as an estimated trillion euros worth of annual EU-UK trade would be at risk as the sides would fall back on general World Trade Organization rules that include tariffs and quotas.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium August 21, 2020. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nThe proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.\n\nWarsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.\n\nIn the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.\n\n“The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,” reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nBut the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders’ summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber.\n\nLiberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber’s work on the matter, said Berlin was “cuddling” with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest.\n\n“Without an automatic sanction system, Germany’s proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,” he told Reuters when asked about the scheme.\n\nAccording to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU’s executive European Commission.\n\nThis could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary.\n\nBut those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law.\n\nThat formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.\n\n“FINGER-WAGGING”\n\nSome have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.\n\n“It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn’t find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,” said one official working on the matter.\n\nGermany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc’s next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021.\n\nAsked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.\n\n“There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn’t like our government,” he told reporters.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.8568 euros)",

They said their son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nA couple of months later the school authorities informed him he would no longer teach kindergarten children, he said. “I think the decision they took was quite sad,” said Helaine.\n\nA spokesman for the local education authority said an agreement was reached with Helaine to move him away from teaching kindergarten. Pupils under six “could be frightened by his appearance”, the spokesman said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. “I’m a primary school teacher ... I love my job.”\n\nHe said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an “existential crisis”. Since then, he said, “Getting tattoos is my passion.”\n\nHe said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. “Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,” he said.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, and she pledged to become a justice in the mold of the late staunch conservative Antonin Scalia, setting another milestone in Trump’s rightward shift of the top U.S. judicial body.\n\nTrump’s announcement during a flag-festooned White House Rose Garden ceremony - with Barrett, 48, by his side and her seven children on hand - sets off a scramble by Senate Republicans to confirm her as the president has requested before Election Day in 5-1/2 weeks, when he will be seeking a second term in office.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at age 87 on Sept. 18, Barrett would become the fifth woman ever to serve on the court and would push its conservative majority to a commanding 6-3.\n\nLike Trump’s two other appointees, Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, Barrett is young enough that she could serve for decades in the lifetime job, leaving a lasting conservative imprint. Barrett is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since conservative Clarence Thomas was 43 in 1991.\n\nScalia, who died in 2016, was one of the most influential conservative justices in recent history. Barrett previously served as a clerk for Scalia on the high court and described him as her mentor, citing his “incalculable influence” on her life.\n\n“His judicial philosophy is mine too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers,” Barrett said.\n\nOn the court, Scalia voted to curb abortion rights, dissented when the court legalized gay marriage - he called it a “judicial putsch” - and backed broad gun rights, among other positions.\n\nWith Trump’s fellow Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, confirmation appears certain, although Democrats may try to make it as difficult as possible.\n\nAn emboldened Supreme Court conservative majority could shift the United States to the right on hot-button issues by, among other things, curbing abortion rights, expanding religious rights, striking down gun control laws, halting the expansion of LGBT rights, and endorsing new restrictions on voting rights.\n\nBarrett, a devout Roman Catholic who earned her law degree and taught at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, was appointed by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 and is a favorite of religious conservatives, a key Trump voter bloc.\n\n“Today it is my honor to nominate one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said Barrett would be the first mother of school-age children ever on the court. Along with her lawyer husband, her children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, were in the audience.\n\nLater on Saturday evening, the president drew loud cheers from thousands of supporters at a campaign rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania, when he called Barrett “an extraordinary scholar” who would defend their “God-given rights and freedoms.”\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“She should be running for president,” he said, comparing her academic record to that of his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nBarrett also praised Ginsburg, saying the late justice was “a woman of enormous talent and consequence” and mentioned Ginsburg’s long friendship with Scalia.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nMOVING AHEAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement praising Barrett and pledging to move forward quickly with the confirmation process. But Biden repeated his call for the appointment to be made by the winner of the Nov. 3 election.\n\n“The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress,” Biden said.\n\nDemocrats are still furious over McConnell’s 2016 refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland because it came during an election year. This marks the first time since 1956 that a U.S. president has moved to fill a Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\n\nFormer presidential candidate and senator Bernie Sanders called Republican efforts to push through the nomination “an absolute outrage” and said Americans should fight “as hard as we can to ensure that this nominee is not confirmed.”\n\nBarrett is expected to begin traditional courtesy calls on individual senators on Tuesday. Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings will begin Oct. 12, Trump said.\n\nDemocrats are set to make the fate of the Obamacare healthcare law a key part of the confirmation fight.\n\nBarrett could be on the bench for the court’s Nov. 10 oral arguments in a case in which Trump and fellow Republicans are seeking to invalidate the 2010 law, formally called the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Justice Ginsburg must be turning over in her grave up in heaven,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said, “to see that the person they chose seems to be intent on undoing all the things that Ginsburg did.”",

  "text": "LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser Group RB.L is preparing to sell some of its non-core personal care brands, including Veet hair removal cream and Clearasil acne cream, four sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Products produced by Reckitt Benckiser; Vanish, Finish, Dettol and Harpic, are seen in London, Britain February 12, 2008. REUTERS/Stephen Hird\n\nThe package of brands up for sale - which also includes E45 skin cream and Scholl foot products - could be worth as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in a sale, two of the sources said, based on estimates of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation north of 120 million pounds.\n\nThe process comes as Reckitt is generating unusually strong sales in its hygiene business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as people snap up its Lysol and Dettol disinfectants. It is also a strategic step for its new chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, who has been in the top job for one year.\n\nVeet hair removal creams may also be seeing a boost, another source said, as people curb salon visits and do more grooming at home.\n\nReckitt is working with advisers and has already sent out information on the assets, two of the sources said.\n\nReckitt declined to comment.\n\nThe brands are likely to appeal to private equity players, the sources said, since they are cash-generative.\n\nThey do not fit into the two main businesses Reckitt has been focusing on - health and hygiene.\n\nUnilever ULVR.LUNA.AS, Beiersdorf BEIG.DE and Henkel HNKG_p.DE all sell personal care products and also therefore could be potential suitors, the sources said. Beiersdorf and Henkel, both based in Germany, are interested in parts of the package, two of the sources said.\n\nHenkel declined to comment. Beiersdorf and Unilever were not immediately available.\n\nUK-based Reckitt, which started out as a home cleaning company, for years worked to build out its health-related business, which includes Enfamil formula, Durex condoms and Nurofen tablets.\n\nA strategy by previous management to separate the health and hygiene units into two stand-alone, in-house businesses, which led to speculation of a corporate break-up, was later scrapped.",

They did not name the other investor.\n\nCerberus and HSBC declined to comment.\n\nHSBC has previously said the business is under a strategic review.\n\nBoth bidders want the business to be fully recapitalised with HSBC injecting at least 500 million euros before they can buy it for a symbolic amount of one euro, the sources said.\n\n“The price is going to be disastrous for HSBC,” of the sources said.\n\nWhile the British lender is still working to reach an agreement by the end of the year, the process could still fall through due to regulatory demands and the prospect of heavy job cuts, another source said.\n\nThe sale process is culminating just as European bank share prices come under fresh pressure due to concerns about the economic impact of a second wave of COVID-19, with the STOXX 600 bank index .SX7P hitting a record low on Friday.\n\nHSBC France said in its first half results that its private banking and wealth management business posted a 225 million adjusted loss before tax.\n\nFailure to complete the sale would be a significant hit to HSBC’s restructuring, as the bank attempts to complete the latest of a series of asset disposals in recent years aimed at improving returns for long-suffering shareholders by shedding underperforming businesses.\n\n($1 = 0.8587 euros)",

  "text": "A quote attributed to the late Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg has resurfaced online following her death on Sept. 18, 2020. The quote is unfounded.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS\n\nThe posts, portrayed as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat misinformation, attribute the quote, “Pedophilia is good for the children” to Bader Ginsburg. Examples can be seen here , here&set=a.107983197646925&type=3&theater and here&set=a.655878288391872&type=3&theater.\n\nSome posts and comments mention child trafficking and present Bader Ginsburg as seeking to normalize pedophilia (here&set=a.655878288391872&type=3&theater) They fit a narrative put forth by conspiracy theorists from the group QAnon.\n\nConspiracy theories by the group QAnon often allude to a “secret campaign” waged by U.S. President Donald Trump against a sex trafficking ring, known as Pizzagate. This stems from a fake online report that a Washington D.C. pizza restaurant was cover for a child sex trafficking ring (here). The New York Times explains the conspiracy theory in depth (here) . Some social media users are reviving these theories in the run-up to the November election.\n\nThe New York Times reported in August that followers of the conspiracy theory have been sharing the hashtag ‘SaveTheChildren’ and ‘SaveOurChildren’, taking resources away from genuine child trafficking hotlines and groups working to tackle this issue (here).\n\nThese posts offer no date or source for their quote. Fact-checkers have debunked this false quote in the past (here, here, here), usually noting it was presented in conjunction with or built on the false claim that Bader-Ginsburg sought to lower the age of consent to 12 years old.\n\nCrowdtangle says the pedophilia quote was first shared on public Facebook pages in early July 2020, while the age of consent quote was first shared around November 2019.\n\nReuters debunked the age of consent claim in detail, here. Social media posts claimed Bader Ginsburg said: “The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to age 12 years old.” This was not a direct quote by Bader Ginsburg and stemmed from a mistaken interpretation by third parties of legal recommendations presented by Bader Ginsburg in the 1970s to make definitions of rape more gender-neutral.\n\nVERDICT\n\nFalse. Ruth Bader Ginsburg never said “pedophilia is good for the children.”\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .",

  "text": "Social media users have been sharing images of meat with spots on it and claiming it is a deadly and dangerous animal tuberculosis virus. This claim is misleading: when cooked properly, animal tuberculosis in meat is not harmful to humans.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post’s description reads: “Dear meat buyer, if you seen these bubbles, you should know it’s blebs containing deadly and dangerous tuberculosis virus, please help us to spread this to keep people safe.” The claim is referring to bovine tuberculosis, also known as Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). The bacterium is found in cattle and other animals, including deer, bison and elk.\n\nThe photographs in some posts show bovine tuberculosis. Two photographs in these claims (an example here ) stem from a Purdue University Forestry and Natural Resources paper on bovine tuberculosis in deer visible on page three here .\n\nThe image from another post claiming to show animal tuberculosis here is featured on two Arabic language websites that identify the image as showing “pinworm egg sacs” ( www.elbalad.news/2749237 and bit.ly/3cB82KM ).\n\nThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game advises that cooking meat kills tapeworm parasites ( here ). WebMD, an online publisher of news and information pertaining to human health, explains people can get infected if they “eat or drink something that contains tapeworm eggs or larvae, like raw or undercooked beef or pork.” ( here ) Pinworm infections, on the other hand, are not usually spread by eating meat , WebMD and the New York Department of Health say ( here ).\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that most tuberculosis cases in the United States are caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), but that M. bovis can also cause tuberculosis in humans and affect various parts of the human body ( here ).\n\nSometimes, a person infected with M. bovis may not appear sick, have symptoms or be contagious to others. The CDC says that, when symptoms manifest, they can include fever, weight loss and coughing, depending on which part of the body is affected. The disease is treated with antibiotics.\n\nHumans are infected by consuming unpasteurized and contaminated dairy products. Infection can also take place from direct contact with a wound, or inhaling bacteria from an infected animal. M. bovis causes less than 2% of the total number of tuberculosis cases (less than 230 cases per year) in the United States and most humans are at very low risk, the CDC says ( here ). Those who work with animals or products from the animals, such as farmers, butchers and hunters, may be at increased risk.\n\nThe California Department of Food and Agriculture says on its website that the bacteria are killed when “meat is cooked and milk is pasteurized.” ( here )\n\nA U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) spokesman told Reuters via email that meat must be properly cooked and handled to avoid animal to human transmission of M. bovis. Safe cooking guidelines for meat by the U.S. government can be seen here .\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Animal Industry began a national tuberculosis eradication program in 1917, sharply reducing levels of M. bovis infection (see Bovine Tuberculosis History tab here ).\n\nRuss Daly, extension veterinarian and professor in the veterinary and biomedical sciences department at South Dakota State University, addressed public health concerns about bovine tuberculosis in a June 2020 article ( here ). Daly said: “The general public is protected from bovine tuberculosis by the federal and state meat inspection system identifying TB in slaughtered animals. Cooking and pasteurization will kill M. bovis in meat and milk.”\n\nVERDICT\n\nPartly false. While some of these images do show meat infected with bovine tuberculosis, meat cooked following health guidelines renders these cases of infection harmless to humans.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

The picture shows an infant with a face mask under the caption: “2019: Back is best, fitted sheet only, no stuffed animals in crib to reduce SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) risk. 2020:” It implies that the use of face masks on babies is in line with recommendations.\n\nThis claim contradicts advice published by health authorities.

REUTERS\n\nThe post from Sept. 11, 2020 can be seen here and is accompanied by the caption: “It’s a tough call. Do I risk getting COVID with its 99.9% recovery rate or do I get the vaccine with its 80% Adverse Reaction rate, and (which) has killed 5 people so far in the trials? What a predicament.”\n\nThere have been no reports of any deaths as scientists race to produce a vaccine against COVID-19. Dozens of vaccines are being developed. Their status can be tracked via this in-depth graphic from Reuters (here) .\n\nAmong the most advanced vaccines in development is AstraZeneca’s. The company has resumed British clinical trials of the vaccine after putting them on hold earlier this month, when a participant became ill (here ) . As of Sept. 24, the company said it was still waiting for FDA approval to re-start its U.S. trials (here ) . Following the earlier phase 1/2 trial, it reported that there were no serious adverse events among participants. Fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported reactions (here) .\n\nAnother leading contender is Moderna, which said it has enrolled over 25,000 participants in its late-stage study (here ) . Following its Phase 1 study, it reported that no study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions, such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site (here) .\n\nPfizer has also said participants showed mild to moderate side effects when given its experimental coronavirus vaccine (here) .\n\nChinese firm SinoVac has said its CoronaVac did not cause severe side effects in early phases of its trials in May (here) .\n\nRussia’s Sputnik-5 vaccine trials reported no serious side effects in results published this month by medical journal The Lancet (here) and (here) .\n\nThe Facebook post also mentions COVID-19 “with its 99.9% recovery rate”.\n\nExperts have been careful to use the terms mortality rate or recovery rate, partly because the numbers of deaths and patients are constantly changing, and partly because not every single case of the virus will be detected (here) .\n\nVERDICT\n\nFalse.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nAt least one post (here) making the claim on Facebook includes two pictures of men lying on the floor at the demonstration, which was organised in protest at renewed restrictions to curb the new coronavirus and against mass vaccinations.\n\nThe caption alongside the pictures reads: “Reports of two deaths at Saturday anti-fascism rally, unconfirmed. 2 men were beaten unconscious by the fascist police. Crowds chanted ‘choose your side’ as police repeatedly tried to charge crowds, described by media as ‘anti-vaxx, flat-earthers’.”\n\nOther posts did not include pictures, but still claimed a man had been killed “by a baton” to the head (here, here, here) .\n\nNone of these claims is accurate. No deaths were reported by authorities or the media at – or following – the protest in London on Sept. 19 (here) .\n\nIn the initial Facebook post claiming “reports of two deaths,” one of the photos included shows a man in a blue T-shirt lying on the floor (bit.ly/303MTDN) . Earlier footage captured from another angle shows the same man interacting with officers before they appear to move him to the ground (here , here). It is not clear what causes the commotion. He is then seen being carried away toward a convoy of police vans (here , 14:26 onwards), before later being filmed sitting up on a stretcher and talking to surrounding officers (here) .\n\nThe second photo in the Facebook post of a man on the floor (bit.ly/3cvvfOj) is a moment that was captured from several angles (here) . It is not clear what happened in the lead-up to this incident, but later photos show him being placed on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance (here) .\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a Twitter statement a man was “taken unwell” as he was being arrested at the protest, and he was later taken to hospital. The Twitter statement said: “Officers attempted to speak with the man after a traffic cone was thrown towards them. The man ran from police but was detained. As he was being arrested, he became unwell. He was taken by the [London Ambulance Service] to a south London hospital for treatment and was subsequently released back into police custody.”\n\nAt the time of the statement, on Sept. 20, the Met said the same man was still in custody having been arrested on suspicion of assault on police and possession of Class A drugs.

  "text": "Social media users have been sharing a photograph of a gas station sign that shows high gas prices with the claim this happened “last time Joe Biden was in the White House” as Vice President. One post reads, “This is where gas prices will soon be if you elect Biden.” The photographs in these claims predate the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne image in these posts visible here shows a Shell Food Mart sign with gas prices and a desert backdrop.\n\nAn April 2008 photograph of the same sign (see rock formation on its base) with similar prices can be seen here . According to this caption, the gas station in the photograph is in Panamint Springs, California. Another photograph with similar prices and the same location is dated March 2008 ( here ).\n\nGasoline prices are affected by many factors. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) links them chiefly to the price of unrefined crude and to supply and demand. “World crude oil prices reached record levels in 2008 as a result of high worldwide oil demand relative to supply.” ( here )\n\nLower demand and the 2008 Great Recession (explained in more detail here and here ), led to the eventual decrease in gas prices ( here ). (The Atlantic reported in 2012 that the hike in gas prices may have played a role in causing the Great Recession here .)\n\nA photograph in other posts, visible here , shows a Shell Snack Shop sign with gas prices and a blue sky backdrop. The image appears to be cropped. This image was originally posted to Twitter by Fox Los Angeles journalist Bill Melugin in October 2019 ( here ). During this time, gas prices increased due to refinery outages which decreased the supply ( here ).\n\nFormer president Barack Obama and his vice president Joe Biden were in office between Jan. 20, 2009 and Jan. 20, 2017. The photographs featured in these claims are from 2008 and 2019, making the link in these claims false.\n\nMore broadly, California is known for having higher gas prices due to fewer supply sources than other states. The EIA explains that, “California refineries need to run at near full capacity to meet the state's gasoline demand. If more than one of its refineries experiences operating problems at the same time, California's gasoline prices can increase substantially.” ( here )\n\nA graph showing U.S. gas prices and their fluctuation over the past decades can be seen on the EIA’s website here&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m as well as on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics here (users must select “Gasoline, unleaded regular, per gallon” under selected items to view). The graphs show a sharp drop after a rise in 2008.\n\nVERDICT\n\nFalse.

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing tax-return data.\n\nIn a report that Trump dismissed as “fake news,” the Times said the Republican president also paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017, despite receiving $427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.\n\nThe disclosure of previously private tax information came little more than a month before the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Democrats were quick to seize on the report to paint Trump as a tax dodger and raise questions about his carefully groomed image as a savvy businessman.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to ask Americans to raise their hands if they paid more in federal income tax than Trump.\n\nCalling the report “total fake news” at a White House news conference, Trump again cited an ongoing audit as his reason for not releasing his returns. In a statement to the Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said Trump had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade, without weighing in on the specific finding of minimal income taxes.\n\nTrump’s consistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates. He is currently in a legal battle with New York City prosecutors and congressional Democrats who are seeking to obtain his returns.\n\nHe also previously indicated he preferred to minimize his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him “smart.”\n\nThe Times reported that Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire. It said he claimed $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite saying he had income of at least $434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.\n\nThe Times emphasized the documents reveal only what Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth.\n\nThe Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization. It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.\n\nThe Times also reported that Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service audit over a $72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him in that audit, he could have to pay over $100 million, according to the newspaper.",

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

He added: “I am very grateful to Chancellor Merkel for visiting me in hospital.”\n\nThe Navalny case has further worsened relations between Moscow and a number of Western countries.

  "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects across markets, and investors are already trying to identify potential winners and losers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers a speech on the U.S. Supreme Court at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., September 27, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBroadly speaking, analysts say Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes could pressure company earnings. But they expect him to support infrastructure projects and renewable energy.\n\nA second Trump term, meanwhile, may bring more tax cuts and extend de-regulation that could benefit the energy and financial sectors, while risking continued tensions with China.\n\nWith the Senate majority also at stake, the election could allow one party to control the presidency and Congress, making it easier to enact legislation such as the additional fiscal stimulus currently being held up in a political standoff.\n\nHere is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:\n\nBIDEN BASKET\n\nALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A stronger expected “green energy” push under a Biden administration could support alternative energy stocks. For example, tax credit extensions would provide a boost for solar stocks such as Sunnova Energy International, SunPower Corp and Enphase Energy, according to Credit Suisse.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES: Tesla shares already have had a mammoth run during the Trump administration, but some believe a Biden presidency could further fuel the electric vehicle company’s shares.\n\n“Biden has proposed new tax incentives, government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs in particular,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in a report.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nOther potential winners from a Biden victory would be auto suppliers focused on electrification and green, emission-free technologies, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner and Visteon, Nelson wrote.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE: A large infrastructure spending package “may be an early priority for a Biden administration as it seeks a bipartisan win,” according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nBiden’s plan would boost a broad group of engineering and construction companies, with AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group and MasTec among the biggest beneficiaries, according to Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz.\n\nTARIFF TRADE: A Biden administration could see a calming of the U.S.-China tariff war. “Should trade policy be less-focused on the use of tariffs, both importers and exporters may benefit,” according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nJP Morgan in a July report listed Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher and 3M among a number of stocks that could outperform should a Biden presidency lead to a “de-escalation” in U.S.-China tariff tensions.\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nTAX RELIEF: A Biden loss could spell additional relief for companies that benefited from the president’s corporate tax cuts.\n\nIn its July report, JP Morgan listed AT&T, Target and Waste Management among companies that benefited from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could underperform in a Biden presidency.\n\nBANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration, particularly if a progressive such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a high-profile role.\n\nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say a Trump win with Republicans retaining the Senate is the best election scenario for banks, noting “the Republican agenda of reduced regulation remains intact.” Stocks to own in that scenario include Wells Fargo and Citigroup, KBW wrote.\n\nDEFENSE: Trump would probably “succeed in maintaining large defense spending, despite a Democratic House, given the reality of great power struggle with China and Russia,” BCA Research strategists said in a recent report.\n\nFOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES: “Support for energy companies and specifically fossil fuels appears to be an ongoing objective for Trump,” according to LPL’s Detrick. He added that most companies in this sector, excluding those in renewable energy, will likely benefit from a Trump victory.",

REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nChina has ramped up efforts to get international groups and companies to refer on their websites and in official documents to democratic, self-ruled Taiwan as being part of China, to the ire of Taiwan’s government and many of its people.\n\nOver the weekend, Taiwan officials expressed anger after the Brussels-based Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy began listing on its website its six Taiwan member cites as belonging to China.\n\nThe mayors of the cities then wrote an open letter calling for the decision to be reversed.\n\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said after the protest, the group had reverted to its original designation of the cities as being part of Chinese Taipei, a name Taiwan uses in some international bodies like the Olympics to avoid Beijing’s objections to its participation.\n\nThe European Union “helped us in this effort”, Wu told parliament, without giving details.\n\n“We are very happy that with everyone’s hard work the name has reverted,” he said.\n\n“Though some people may not be happy with this name, at least the way we participate is not placed under another country.”\n\nThe Global Covenant, in a short statement, blamed a “technical glitch in the database” for the designation change, which it said had now been corrected.\n\nThe European Commission said it was “made aware of this issue over the weekend”, and referred to the Global Covenant’s statement about a technical glitch.\n\nNo EU member states have diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the EU itself tends to keep a low profile when it comes to Taiwan, wary of upsetting China, its second largest trading partner.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\n\n“Cities in the Taiwan region certainly should be listed as Chinese,” he told reporters.",

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nThe suspect, who is from Pakistan, was arrested soon after two people were wounded in front of the old offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. Officials said his clothes were spattered in blood.\n\nThe video was found on the suspect’s mobile phone, French media reported. Reuters could not independently authenticate the video recording. A police source confirmed a video was being examined.\n\nIn the video, the suspect identifies himself as Zeheer Hassan Mehmood and says he came from Mandi Bahauddin in Punjab province. Starting to sob, he then recites poetry praising the Prophet Mohammad.\n\n“If I’m sounding emotional, let me explain: here, in France, the caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad were made,” he says in Urdu. “I am going to do (an act of) resistance today, Sept. 25.”\n\nMehmood’s father praised his son.\n\n“My heart is filled with happiness,” Arshad Mehmood told the online news site Naya Pakistan from the family home. “I can sacrifice all my five sons to protect the Prophet’s honour.”\n\n“He called us ... and said that the God’s Prophet had chosen him, and assigned him to kill the blasphemers.”\n\nThe cartoons were first published by Charlie Hebdo in 2006 and spurred Islamist militants to target the magazine’s office in 2015 in an attack that left 12 people dead and was claimed by al Qaeda.\n\nThe weekly, which moved to a secret location after the attack, republished the cartoons earlier this month to mark the beginning of the trial of 14 people with alleged links to the Charlie Hebdo killers.\n\nFor Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.\n\nWearing a long tunic, the suspect said he was spiritually guided by Ilyas Qadri. Qadri is a Sunni cleric and the founder of Dawat-e-Islami, a non-violent organisation spread across the globe.\n\nQadri says a person who commits blasphemy should be handed in to police, but if another individual were driven by their emotions to kill the blasphemer, the law should not apply.\n\nDawat-e-Islami did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Soon after Meng’s detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, charging them with espionage.\n\nMeng will appear in British Columbia’s Supreme Court on Monday for five days of Vukelich hearings - in which the judge will ultimately decide whether to allow the defence to admit additional pieces of evidence in their favour.\n\nIn this case, Huawei lawyers will use a PowerPoint presentation to show HSBC knew the extent of Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, which they say the United States did not accurately portray in its extradition request to Canada.\n\nIn previously submitted documents, Meng’s lawyers claim the case that the United States submitted to Canada is “so replete with intentional and reckless error” that it violates her rights.\n\nThe argument is part of Meng’s legal strategy to prove that Canadian and American authorities committed abuses of process while arresting her.\n\nLawyers representing the Canadian attorney general are arguing for her extradition to the United States.\n\nVukelich hearings are rare in extradition cases, said Gary Botting, an extradition lawyer based in Vancouver, but given the complexity of Meng’s case it is not surprising.\n\nThe defence’s success “depends entirely on the nature of the evidence… and whether or not there is any substance to their allegations,” Botting added.\n\nMeng’s extradition trial is currently set to wrap up in April 2021, although if either side appeals the case, it could drag on for years through the Canadian justice system.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined “at this time” to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols’ detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it “will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.”\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump’s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his “blessing.”\n\nBut key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its “ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.”\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational”.\n\n“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on “bullying and extortion”.\n\nTrump’s administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.”\n\nAnother U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings’ WeChat from U.S. app stores.",

  "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Uber has won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence which was taken away over safety concerns, after a judge ruled on Monday that the company was a fit and proper operator despite “historical failings”.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a “pattern of failures”, including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.\n\nUber argued it has since assuaged concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.\n\nThe U.S. company was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017, in a major blow in one of its most important markets, before it was restored on a probationary basis.\n\n“I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,” Judge Tan Ikram said on Monday.\n\n“Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London... operator’s licence,” he said, granting an 18-month right to take rides.\n\nUber, which has apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into backlashes and regulatory challenges elsewhere, including in its home state of California.\n\nShares in Uber rose 6% in pre-market U.S. trading after the decision.\n\n“This decision is a recognition of Uber’s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s boss for Northern and Eastern Europe, said.\n\nIn London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt.\n\nThe city’s traditional black cab drivers have blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also chairs TfL, warned Uber on Monday to stick to its obligations.\n\n“I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers,” he said in a statement.",

  "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are increasingly divided over how to steer the economy through a second wave of COVID-19, threatening President Christine Lagarde’s hard-won peace, conversations with eight ECB insiders show.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde gestures as she addresses a news conference on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, in Frankfurt, Germany, March 12, 2020. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nLagarde has managed to end the public infighting that left the ECB in disarray in the final months of Mario Draghi’s tenure last year and she has seamlessly pushed through several record stimulus packages to keep the economy afloat amid the pandemic.\n\nHer pledge to seek consensus and bring sceptics onboard is in stark contrast to her predecessor Draghi, who rarely engaged key opponents of his policies and signalled moves even before any discussion within the Governing Council.\n\nBut tensions are rising again as a fresh surge in infections forces the ECB to contemplate even more stimulus, with old rifts resurfacing and chief economist Philip Lane coming under fire from all sides.\n\nConservative policymakers, known in central bank jargon as “hawks”, argue that the ECB is downplaying some of the good news, such as a stream of better-than-expected economic indicators over the summer.\n\nIn the opposite corner, “dovish” central bankers are pushing Lagarde to adapt stronger language both on the risks to growth and the threat from the euro’s appreciation against the dollar.\n\nDisagreements were already clear during the last policy meeting in September, the eight sources, all with direct knowledge of the process, told Reuters.\n\nThe hawks wanted the ECB to quietly reduce its bond purchases given the relatively benign market conditions, saving its firepower so it can raise the pace of buying again if needed at a later date without increasing the overall size of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).\n\nSome also argued that economic projections were too pessimistic because they failed to account for fiscal stimulus measures already announced which would inevitably lead to higher growth and inflation.\n\nBoth of these points were rejected by chief economist Lane, but so was a call to give a clearer warning about the risks to growth from a stronger euro, the sources said.\n\nThe ECB, which speaks on behalf of board members, declined to comment.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nDOVISH REBELLION?\n\nWhile most policymakers have echoed Lagarde’s “wait and see” stance in public statements, some took a decisively dovish tone in the meeting, openly discussing prospects for more stimulus, something Lagarde has deliberately steered clear of.\n\nSome of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, especially objected to ECB board member Fabio Panetta’s comments last week that the ECB should err on the side of doing too much rather than too little.\n\nPanetta, who joined the board at the start of the year, argued that inflation was uncomfortably below the ECB’s target and in such situations a policy response may be necessary.\n\n“It’s like Mario is back,” one of the sources said, referring to Draghi’s tendency to deviate from the Governing Council’s message and front-run policy before others had a chance to weigh in.\n\nBut the sources added that Lagarde is for now keeping her end of the bargain and she is even engaging with policymakers Draghi did not talk to.\n\n“She’s working the phones non-stop and managed to get a consensus in June so I have no reason to think she’s about to change her style,” another source said.\n\nSome senior ECB staff have advocated increasing the quota for emergency bond buying to 2 trillion euros from the current 1.35 trillion euros but Lagarde pushed back on that suggestion, bolstering her credibility among policymakers who were often at odds with Draghi, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources said that while policy action may be necessary in December, bringing disagreements into the public domain and fuelling market expectations with dovish comments could make it more difficult to keep it consensual.\n\n“If you front-run policy in public debate, then you harden positions and make it difficult to compromise,” one of the sources said. “That’s when you get public dissent and market confusion.”\n\nThe sources also agreed that while the possibility of a rate cut was still there, as often stated by the bank, there was no appetite for such a move and it was not being discussed.\n\nLANE ON THE SPOT\n\nWhile the majority of policymakers were happy with Lagarde’s management style, Lane, who is seen as the most influential voice on policy matters, was criticised by both factions.\n\nOn the one hand, he was criticised for a choice of words deemed too timid on the euro’s appreciation at the Sept. 10 policy meeting, underwhelming traders.\n\nSome policymakers had insisted during the policy meeting on tougher language, like that used by Draghi in 2018, but Lane pushed back, two sources said.\n\nOn the other hand, hawks objected to Lane’s blog post the day after the meeting, in which he took a dimmer view on inflation and warned against complacency, suggesting he wanted to amend the agreed policy message, several sources said.\n\nOther signs of the tension, the sources said, were the growing number of leaks from the Governing Council, some of which lack credibility and are designed to steer the debate, rather than reveal it.\n\nOne leak suggested the ECB was contemplating extending emergency powers to its open-ended bond purchase scheme, a notion Yves Mersch, who also heads the ECB’s legal services, rejected.\n\n“No such thing was ever discussed,” a second source said. “Removing limits indefinitely would be a guaranteed way to get us sent back to court.”",

  "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - Just four days into the new school year, Trevor Boutilier’s five-year-old son was sent home from his Ottawa kindergarten with a runny nose and slight cough, and told to stay away until he’d had a COVID-19 test and was symptom free.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A teacher helps a student close his personal hand sanitizer as he arrives for the first time since the start of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic at Hunter's Glen Junior Public School, part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada September 15, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Osorio/File Photo\n\nThe local testing center was overrun, so Boutilier drove his son miles out of the city to a small town for the test. They waited for four days for the result, which came back negative.\n\nBy then, his son, who suffers seasonal allergies, had been symptom free for days and missed nearly a week of school.\n\n“If you’re going to send them home and have them get COVID tested for every runny nose and every sniffle then you’re never going to have any kids in school,” Boutilier said. “You’re just going to have line-ups upon line-ups at the testing centers.”\n\nThe long checklist of symptoms that Canadian schools and daycare centers use to screen children has emerged as a major point of contention for parents. Like Boutilier, they say it is overly restrictive, especially in cold and allergy season, and will force children to miss classes and parents to miss work.\n\nThis week, British Columbia removed a number of common cold symptoms from its checklist, including runny noses and sore throats, saying those symptoms in isolation should not keep kids at home.\n\nEpidemiologists supported the move, and Ontario and Manitoba are now reconsidering their stay-home checklists. Doctors were less sanguine.\n\n“I’m sort of surprised they’d be doing this as COVID cases are going up,” said Dr Anna Banerji, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Toronto.\n\n“A lot of kids that get COVID don’t have a fever or shortness of breath,” she said, pointing to symptoms still on British Columbia’s checklist. “I think you’re going to miss a lot of cases.”\n\nNew COVID-19 infections have surged in Canada in recent days, with an average of 1,144 new cases reported daily over the past week, up sharply from a daily average of 380 in mid-August. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that the second wave had arrived.\n\nThe surge, coupled with the reopening of schools for the new term, has led to long line-ups at testing centers in many major cities.\n\nCanada’s official opposition leader, Erin O’Toole, slammed Trudeau’s government last week after facing a long wait at an Ottawa testing center and called for rapid testing. He is now in isolation after his test came back positive.\n\n“Sore throats and runny nose are symptoms of COVID-19, but they’re also symptoms of other well known viruses,” said Vancouver doctor Funmi Okunola, who is pushing for rapid home testing. “The only way we can tell the difference between the two is through testing.”\n\nBut home collection kits are still being reviewed by Health Canada, leaving daily symptom checklists as the best screening option for now, though epidemiologists said the kitchen-sink approach may not be realistic.\n\n“Kids get sick from a lot of stuff and it’s probably impossible to keep all symptomatic kids out of the system indefinitely,” said Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\n“It makes sense to take a few symptoms off the table,” he added, noting the focus should be on screening for symptoms like a fever, the most common indicator of COVID-19 in children.\n\nBut physicians warned that research is still limited.\n\n“The consequence of not being careful in schools is those schools may shut down and then everyone loses,” said Dr Banerji.",

Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Lightning, who lead the best-of-seven final 3-2, will have a chance on Monday to clinch the franchise’s second Stanley Cup when they face off against the Dallas Stars in Game Six in Edmonton, Alberta, one of two COVID-19 bubbles used by the National Hockey League for the postseason.\n\nDallas staved off elimination with a 3-2 win in double overtime on Saturday night.\n\nRecovering from March surgery to repair a core muscle injury, Stamkos has been limited to five shifts and just under three minutes of ice time during the playoffs. But he made them count, scoring a key goal in the Lightning’s Game Three win that allowed them to take a 2-1 series lead.\n\n“Stammers is done for the series,” said Cooper, adding he discussed the situation with Stamkos earlier on Sunday. “Hopefully the next time you see him on the ice, it will be for the trophy presentation.”\n\nAs team captain, Stamkos would accept the Stanley Cup if the Lightning win the championship.\n\n“He did everything he could to get back and he did get back. Unfortunately, he couldn’t go any further,” Cooper said.\n\n“He’s for sure missed on the ice but the rest of the series is done for him.”\n\nWith the series tied 1-1, Stamkos, twice a winner of the Maurice Richard Trophy as the NHL’s top goal scorer, provided a huge emotional lift, scoring seven minutes into the opening period of Game Three to put Tampa ahead 2-0.\n\nStamkos did not play during the final six minutes of the first period and never took another shift the rest of the game.\n\n“To be honest, I didn’t think he was going to play at all in these playoffs,” said Cooper. “I don’t think any of us did, so he gave us 2:47 of brilliant hockey that is a phenomenal story, scored a huge goal for us in a win and hopefully we can keep that momentum moving forward.”",

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBader hit a triple, blasted a solo homer and scored twice as the fifth-seeded Cardinals will head on the road to face the fourth-seeded San Diego Padres in a National League wild-card series.\n\nWith the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants also losing Sunday, the Brewers grabbed the No. 8 seed in the NL. Milwaukee and the American League’s Houston Astros are the first teams ever to make the playoffs with a losing record. The Brewers will face the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Austin Gomber allowed one run on one hit, two walks and a hit batter in four innings. Reliever Giovanny Gallegos (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings to earn the victory and Alex Reyes closed out the game to earn his first save.\n\nRangers 8, Astros 4\n\nRougned Odor hit a pair of home runs and host Texas parlayed a five-run fourth inning into a victory over Houston, giving the Rangers the four-game series win in Arlington, Texas.\n\nTexas trailed 3-1 before Odor smacked a three-run home run to right field off Astros right-hander Chase De Jong (0-1) with one out in the fourth. Odor clubbed his 10th homer an inning later off right-hander Nivaldo Rodriguez, who entered in relief of De Jong with the bases loaded and two outs in the fourth. Odor finished 2-for-3 with four RBIs, two runs and a walk.\n\nThe Astros, who finished 9-23 on the road, will open their American League wild-card series at Minnesota on Tuesday as the sixth seed. Houston posted its first losing season since 2014 and joined the Milwaukee Brewers in becoming the first teams in baseball history to make the postseason with records below .500.\n\nPadres 5, Giants 4\n\nSan Diego ended host San Francisco’s playoff hopes as Wil Myers doubled, homered and drove in two runs, and the Padres held off the Giants’ comeback bid on the final day of the regular season.\n\nWhile the Padres were already locked into the National League’s No. 4 playoff position, the Giants needed a win and a Milwaukee Brewers loss at St. Louis to claim a wild-card spot. The Cardinals did their part for the Giants, beating the Brewers 5-2, but San Francisco couldn’t complete a rally from a 5-1 deficit.\n\nThe Padres will take a three-game winning streak into their best-of-three home series against the fifth-seeded Cardinals, beginning on Wednesday.\n\nDodgers 5, Angels 0\n\nSix pitchers combined to throw a three-hit shutout to lead the playoff-bound Dodgers to the victory over the Angels at Dodger Stadium.\n\nA.J. Pollock homered twice to propel the Dodgers, and also singled, drove in three runs and scored twice as the Dodgers finished 43-17, the best record in the majors.\n\nThe Dodgers have qualified for the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons, while the Angels finished 26-34 and out of the postseason for the sixth year in a row. Billy Eppler, the Angels’ general manager for five of those seasons, was fired by the club on Sunday.\n\nNationals 15, Mets 5\n\nTrea Turner hit a grand slam and finished with seven RBIs, and 21-year-old Juan Soto became the youngest National League batting champion as host Washington routed New York.\n\nThe Nationals won the final three games of the four-game series to officially move past the Mets in the National League East and avoid becoming just the third reigning World Series champion to finish last. Washington finished fourth by virtue of winning the season series 6-4.\n\nSoto finished the regular season with a .351 batting average, ahead of runner-up Freddie Freeman (.341) and No. 3 Marcell Ozuna (.338), both of the Braves.\n\nMarlins 5, Yankees 0\n\nNew York’s DJ LeMahieu wrapped up the American League batting title, but the Yankees were dealt a shutout loss by visiting Miami in the regular-season finale for both teams.\n\nLeMahieu finished with a .364 batting average to win the AL batting title, and became the first player to win batting titles in both leagues after winning the 2016 crown with Colorado in 2016.\n\nJazz Chisholm hit a two-run double and homered for the Marlins, who secured their first winning record since 2009 but also lost outfielder Starling Marte (ear contusion) and starting pitcher Jose Urena (hand) in the opening three innings.\n\nRed Sox 9, Braves 1\n\nBoston concluded a disappointing season with a power surge, belting four home runs to defeat host Atlanta, which had already won the NL East and secured the No. 2 seed for the playoffs.\n\nThe Red Sox got solo home runs from Jackie Bradley Jr., Xander Bogaerts and Jonathan Arauz, the first of his career. J.D. Martinez hit a two-run opposite-field homer to start a five-run uprising in the seventh that put the game out of reach. Nick Pivetta (2-0) worked five innings and allowed one run on four hits, two walks and five strikeouts.\n\nAtlanta’s Marcell Ozuna fell short in his bid to become the first National League player to win the Triple Crown since Joe “Ducky” Medwick in 1937. Ozuna hit a solo homer, his 18th, and finished with 56 RBIs -- both NL league-leading totals. His average of .338 fell short of the .351 posted by Washington’s Juan Soto.\n\nOrioles 7, Blue Jays 5\n\nCedric Mullins had two triples and two RBIs to help Baltimore salvage the finale of a regular season-ending three-game series with a win over Toronto in Buffalo.\n\nThe Blue Jays, who will enter the playoffs as the No. 8 seed in the American League, still won eight of their 10 meetings with the Orioles this season. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. was 4-for-4 with a two-run homer and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. added a solo shot for Toronto.\n\nOrioles starter Keegan Akin allowed four runs on five hits in three innings. Travis Lakins Sr. (3-2) relieved Akin and permitted a walk and struck out two in two scoreless innings. Cesar Valdez pitched a perfect ninth to earn his third save.\n\nReds 5, Twins 3\n\nEugenio Suarez had two hits and drove in two runs, including one during a three-run 10th inning, as Cincinnati defeated Minnesota in Minneapolis in the final regular-season game for a pair of playoff teams.\n\nJoey Votto walked three times and drove in what proved to be the winning run with a bases-loaded free pass for Cincinnati. The Reds, who were locked into the No. 7 seed in the National League when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-2 earlier on Sunday, will face the second-seeded Atlanta Braves in the National League wild-card round beginning Wednesday.\n\nRaisel Iglesias (4-3) picked up the win despite allowing an unearned run in his 1 1/3 innings. Caleb Thielbar (2-1) took the loss after pitching 1 1/3 innings and giving up one unearned run. Sergio Romo failed to retire any of the four batters he faced.\n\nCubs 10, White Sox 8\n\nKris Bryant and David Bote homered as part of a six-run second inning and Billy Hamilton added a home run and a steal of home, helping the visiting Cubs send their cross-town rivals to an eighth loss in the last 10 games.\n\nThe Cubs led 10-1 entering the eighth inning, but the White Sox scored five runs in the eighth and two in the ninth to bring the tying run to the plate with one out remaining. Andrew Chafin entered and struck out Nomar Mazara to end the game and earn his first save in three chances.\n\nThe Cubs, who clinched the National League Central on Saturday, finished as the No. 3 seed in the eight-team NL playoff field and will host the Miami Marlins in a best-of-three wild-card round series beginning Wednesday. The White Sox will be the No. 7 seed in the AL playoffs, visiting the Oakland Athletics in the wild-card round beginning Tuesday.\n\nDiamondbacks 11, Rockies 3\n\nKole Calhoun homered and finished with two hits, Madison Bumgarner tossed five scoreless innings, and Arizona beat Colorado in Phoenix.\n\nTim Locastro, Ketel Marte, Eduardo Escobar, Nick Ahmed, Wyatt Mathisen and Carson Kelly all finished with two hits for the Diamondbacks. Raimel Tapia and Tony Wolters had two hits each for Colorado.\n\nBumgarner (1-4) didn’t allow a run for the second straight game to earn his first win of the season. The lefty allowed just two hits and struck out four to end his first year with Arizona.\n\nIndians 8, Pirates 6\n\nCarlos Santana and Franmil Reyes each homered and drove in four runs as Cleveland erased a four-run deficit against visiting Pittsburgh and earned the fourth seed in the AL playoffs, hosting the New York Yankees.\n\nReyes hit a three-run homer, and Santana, who entered the game in a 4-for-41 funk, hit a two-run homer and two-run double. The Indians scored three runs in the sixth and three more in the seventh for their largest comeback win of the season.\n\nJose Osuna hit a solo homer and an RBI single, Ke’Bryan Hayes hit a solo homer and Adam Frazier added a two-run double for Pittsburgh.\n\nRays 5, Phillies 0\n\nRookie Josh Fleming spun six scoreless innings as Tampa Bay Rays put an end to Philadelphia’s playoff hopes, finishing their three-game sweep in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nIn a career-long start, Fleming (5-0) recorded five strikeouts and allowed four hits and a walk. Relievers Oliver Drake, Aaron Loup and Ryan Sherriff each tossed a scoreless frame in the six-hit shutout for Tampa Bay, which finished the regular season by winning nine of its last 11 games. Kevan Smith, Mike Brosseau and Nate Lowe all added two hits. The Rays open the postseason against Toronto on Tuesday.\n\nPhillies right-hander Aaron Nola (5-5) took the loss after giving up six hits and three runs in 3 2/3 innings. Bryce Harper had two hits. Philadelphia ended the regular season by losing seven of its final eight games.\n\nA’s 6, Mariners 2\n\nJake Lamb homered leading off the bottom of the seventh inning, sparking a three-run rally as Oakland defeated visiting Seattle.\n\nLamb’s homer to left-center field came on a 2-1 count against Seattle right-hander Yoshihisa Hirano (0-1) and broke a 2-2 tie. Sean Murphy followed by drawing a walk, and an out later, Tony Kemp doubled to right. Chad Pinder walked to load the bases before Mark Canha doubled to center to bring home two runs.\n\nCanha drew a bases-loaded walk with two outs in the eighth for his fourth RBI of the day. A’s right-hander Yusmeiro Petit (2-1) got the victory with a scoreless inning of relief for the American League West champs.\n\nRoyals 3, Tigers 1\n\nBrady Singer allowed one run over seven innings to lead host Kansas City past Detroit in the regular-season finale for both teams.\n\nSinger scattered three hits and struck out five without walking a batter to finish off a solid rookie season at 4-5. The Royals won three of the four games in the series between the two worst teams in the American League Central. Adalberto Mondesi had three hits and drove in two runs.\n\nThe Tigers were limited to just three hits and scored in the first on a two-out, RBI double by Brandon Dixon. Rookie left-hander Tarik Skubal (1-4) took the loss despite allowing just two runs on two hits with six strikeouts and one walk in five innings.\n\n--Field Level Media",

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” has topped $280 million worldwide, dominating a mild U.S. box office with $3.4 million at 2,850 locations in its fourth weekend to go past $41 million in four weeks.\n\nThe Warner Bros. tentpole, which carries a hefty $200 million price tag, took in a weekend total of $19.2 million worldwide in 58 markets. The U.S. posting the top number with a 26% decline, followed by Japan with $3 million in its second weekend and a 30% decline.\n\n“Tenet” is the first major studio release to launch during the pandemic, and its small-ish numbers underline the industry’s challenge of attracting customers amid a health crisis. Disney’s “Mulan”- which isn’t getting a theatrical release in the U.S. -- grossed $3.4 million in 20 markets to lift it to $64 million world wide. Its fifth weekend of “The New Mutants” took in $2.5 million worldwide, including $1.1 million in the U.S.\n\nThe estimates were released three days after Disney postponed the release of a trio of fall blockbusters -- Marvel’s “Black Widow,” Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” and Kenneth Branagh’s “Death on the Nile” -- by several months. Those delays were the latest in a long line of titles pushed out of the summer and fall due to coronavirus.\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said it’s no surprise that the U.S. moviegoing business is subdued amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“This weekend is continuing what’s now expected to become a trend of quieter weekends at the domestic box office in the early autumn weeks following numerous release delays since ‘Tenet’ opened,” he added. “It’s another good news, bad news scenario as ‘Tenet’ itself and other films are displaying stronger legs than typically seen in pre-pandemic times, but the volume of total business in the market is lacking due to modest consumer awareness, the absence of four-quad films, and no promotional engine usually driven by the Los Angeles and New York markets.”\n\nCurrently, about 75% of U.S. markets are open but the key Los Angeles and New York markets remain closed along with most of the rest of California, North Carolina, Michigan, New Mexico, Seattle-Tacoma and Portland. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore, estimated that only 58% of theaters are currently open in North America.\n\n“The marketplace is as expected sleepy and uncertain,” he added. “However, there is at least some encouraging news in the fact that where people have the option, film fans are heading to the movie theater while others are seeking out the big screen experience even in neighboring cities if their local multiplex is unavailable.”",

But there we are: that’s who’s been elected and we have to go through it,” he said.\n\nAttenborough, who launched last week a film about lessons learned during his seven decades as a television naturalist, said that the novel coronavirus lockdown had been relatively painless for him.\n\n“Many people are having a much worse time than I am,” he said. “I am lucky. I have a garden, I have a house... my daughter and I are surviving very well.”\n\n“I’ve certainly spent more time in my garden listening to birds, than I have for a very long time. A lot of people have been surprised by that - a lot of people have suddenly realised what deep, profound joy can come from witnessing the rest of the world - the natural world.”\n\nAhead of the release of his book and Netflix documentary - “A Life On Our Planet”, he called on people to not squander the natural world.\n\nAsked about activities of the Extinction Rebellion campaign group, he said that people should be careful not to break the law.

  "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - When Swedish fashion brand Acne Studios last hosted a catwalk show in Paris in January, it ordered dozens of vegan-friendly rice bowls from cafe owner and caterer Pearlyn Lee for models and crew to pick on backstage.\n\nThose types of orders have all but dried up since the pandemic forced most luxury labels to cancel parties and presentations.\n\nEven as some of the world’s biggest brands return to Paris on Monday, few are planning physical shows, a blow for make-up artists, lighting specialists, caterers and hundreds of other businesses in fashion’s eco-system.\n\n“Basically catering is gone for us. And I’m not sure when it’s coming back,” said Lee, who only last year expanded her kitchen through a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nFrom Monday, 85 brands will showcase womenswear looks during Paris Fashion Week. Only 19 - among them Chanel and LVMH owned Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton - are pressing ahead with socially distanced front rows.\n\nOthers are holding small presentations by appointment, or streaming videos.\n\nFledgling designers can not afford to hire big venues for tiny audiences or risk a last-minute cancellation, said Sebastien Vienne, from production and press firm Mephistopheles.\n\nNone of Mephistopheles’ 14 most regular customers are staging full events next week. In a normal year, each event would have cost at least 30,000 to 40,000 euros.\n\n“We used to do four shows a day, our whole budget comes from these events,” Vienne told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nFILM SETS AND PHOTO SHOOTS\n\nStill, he said he was optimistic revenues would pick up again in the longer run, as brands try to reach shoppers virtually.\n\nHis company is producing a fashion film, rather than a traditional show with an audience, inside the 19th century Hotel Le Marois for Polish label La Metamorphose.\n\nThe palatial venue has also been reinventing itself, upgrading its systems to lure companies wanting to livestream events from its ornate rooms, site manager Valerie Taieb said.\n\nBut even small parties are getting complicated as coronavirus cases in France rise and restrictions on gatherings tighten.\n\n“The fashion sector and the events industry have really been forgotten in this crisis,” Taieb said. Her team of around 20 have only returned to work part-time, and are still relying on the state’s partial unemployment aid.\n\nAt the shoot for La Metamorphose at Hotel Le Marois, 25-year-old model Tiffany Fournier said some of her work had dried up too, although she still does magazine and advertising campaigns.\n\n“I haven’t done a catwalk show since February,” Fournier said.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nSome big brands have pushed to hold physical events where possible in part to support suppliers and other businesses. Designers also want to keep up connections with professional buyers and media.\n\n“There’s an energy and an excitement, there’s music, the first model to appear on the catwalk, applause at the end,” said Alexandre Mattiussi, creator of French brand AMI. “That doesn’t exist in a digital format.”\n\nAMI is planning to hold a show on Oct. 3, with fewer than 150 guests rather than the usual 600 to 700.\n\n“It will be like a very nice wedding,” Mattiussi said.\n\n(This story corrects name in paragraph 7 to Sebastien Vienne not Stephane Vienne)",

  "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian fashion group Valentino ditched the glitzy setting of central Paris for a foundry on the outskirts of Milan to present its latest collection, a rare live catwalk in the time of COVID-19 with a restricted group of mask-wearing guests.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nThe show brought down the curtain on Milan fashion week, which has hosted a mix of physical and virtual catwalks for its first edition since coronavirus restrictions made the heady mix of glamour, celebrity and hype at such events more complicated.\n\nValentino had never presented a women’s collection in Milan, and its last menswear show in Italy’s fashion capital was in 2007.\n\n“In normal times we’d be in Place Vendome in Paris, but now here we are all wearing face masks,” the brand’s designer Pierpaolo Piccioli told reporters after the show.\n\n“When, in late August, we decided to go ahead with the catwalk, it seemed appropriate to support Italy at such a difficult time and give our backing to the Italian fashion system.”\n\nPiccioli picked non-professional models for the show, which combined men’s and women’s designs for Spring/Summer 2021, casting 66 youths in the streets of Milan, Paris and London in a nod to diversity. Some 200 guests attended, or about one-fifth of the usual audience for Valentino’s ready-to-wear shows.\n\nTo live music by British singer Labrinth, they strutted the runway in a series of black and white short dresses, brightly coloured, ruffled chiffon robes, silk overcoats with flower prints, as well as lace and crochet daywear.\n\nThere were also jeans as part of a collaboration project with Levi’s to revive the classic 517 boot cut model made popular in the late 1960s.\n\nThe first country to be hit hard by the virus in Europe, Italy enforced one of the strictest and longest lockdowns from early March. Now new infections are just under 2,000 a day, steadily rising again, but below levels seen in France, Spain and Britain.\n\nIts fashion and textile industry, which with a turnover of 95 billion euros ($98 billion) and 600,000 workers is the second most important nationwide, is reeling from a plunge in sales.\n\nAccording to business lobby Confindustria, exports of women’s fashion fell by 24% in the six months to June.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined “at this time” to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols’ detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it “will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.”\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump’s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his “blessing.”\n\nBut key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its “ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.”\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational”.\n\n“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on “bullying and extortion”.\n\nTrump’s administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.”\n\nAnother U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings’ WeChat from U.S. app stores.",

  "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Uber has won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence which was taken away over safety concerns, after a judge ruled on Monday that the company was a fit and proper operator despite “historical failings”.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a “pattern of failures”, including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.\n\nUber argued it has since assuaged concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.\n\nThe U.S. company was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017, in a major blow in one of its most important markets, before it was restored on a probationary basis.\n\n“I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,” Judge Tan Ikram said on Monday.\n\n“Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London... operator’s licence,” he said, granting an 18-month right to take rides.\n\nUber, which has apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into backlashes and regulatory challenges elsewhere, including in its home state of California.\n\nShares in Uber rose 6% in pre-market U.S. trading after the decision.\n\n“This decision is a recognition of Uber’s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s boss for Northern and Eastern Europe, said.\n\nIn London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt.\n\nThe city’s traditional black cab drivers have blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also chairs TfL, warned Uber on Monday to stick to its obligations.\n\n“I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers,” he said in a statement.",

  "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Technology firms' compliance with European restrictions on transatlantic data transfers is shockingly poor, Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems said on Monday, publishing a survey here of companies including Facebook and Netflix.\n\nFILE PHTOO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of the logo of the European Union in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 15, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in July that the data arrangement set up in 2016, called Privacy Shield, was invalid under Europe’s privacy framework because of concerns about U.S. surveillance.\n\nThe ruling effectively ends the privileged access that U.S. companies such as Facebook had to personal data from Europe. It puts the country on a similar footing to other nations outside the EU, meaning data transfers are likely to face closer scrutiny.\n\nThe survey, conducted by Schrems’ digital rights group NOYB - short for None of Your Business - covered 33 companies. Most were American, but some were based in the EU and Britain.\n\nExercising the right of customers to ask companies how their data is handled under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the survey drew a mixed bag of responses - some firms did not respond and others gave misleading answers.\n\n“The responses ranged from detailed explanations, to admissions that these companies have no clue what is happening, to shockingly aggressive denials of the law,” said Schrems.\n\nNOYB said that rental platform AirBnB, streaming service Netflix and Facebook chat app WhatsApp didn’t reply, while other companies referred to privacy policies that did not address the questions asked.\n\nBusiness collaboration platform Slack said it would not “voluntarily” pass on user data to the U.S. authorities, failing to address concerns that Washington has the legal power to conduct targeted surveillance of non-U.S. citizens overseas.\n\n“Overall, we were astonished by how many companies were unable to provide little more than a boilerplate answer,” said Schrems.\n\n“The companies that did provide answers largely are simply not complying with the CJEU judgment. It seems that most of the industry still does not have a plan as to how to move forward.”",

  "text": "路透纽约9月28日 - 无论是拜登还是特朗普在美国11月3日总统大选中胜出，都可能会对各个金融市场造成戏剧化影响，投资人目前已经在试图找出潜在的赢家与输家。\n\n资料图片：2020年9月18日，美国弗吉尼亚州，Fairfax政府中心摆放的支持特朗普和拜登竞选的广告。REUTERS/Al Drago\n\n整体而言，分析师认为拜登调高公司税赋的计划可能令企业获利承压。但他们预期拜登将支持基础建设项目及再生能源。\n\n特朗普若获得连任，则可能进一步减税并继续放宽监管，可望使能源和金融业受惠，但同时可能会持续与中国的摩擦。\n\n由于参议院的多数席次也可能变化，这场选举的结果也许出现总统及国会皆由同一政党拿下的情形，使立法工作变得容易，例如目前因为政治僵局而卡在国会的额外财政刺激计划可能会取得进展。\n\n以下是拜登或特朗普获胜的情景下可能受惠最多的类股：\n\n**受益于拜登的一方**\n\n新能源：若拜登入主白宫，市场对“绿色能源”的期望增强，可能支撑新能源类股。比如，据瑞士信贷称，延长税收抵免将提振Sunnova Energy InternationalNOVA.N、SunPowerSPWR.O和Enphase EnergyENPH.O等太阳能股。\n\n电动汽车：特斯拉TSLA.O股价在特朗普任期内已是一涨再涨，不过一些人认为拜登当选后可能会进一步助燃该公司股价。\n\n“拜登提出了新的税收优惠、政府购买和其他措施，这些特别有利于电动车企业。”CFRA分析师Garrett Nelson在报告中称。\n\nNelson还写道，其他可从拜登获胜中受益的潜在赢家还将有专注于电气化和绿色能源技术的汽车供应商，比如Aptiv APTV.N、BorgWarnerBWA.N和Visteon VC.O。\n\n基础设施：LPL Financial首席市场策略师Ryan Detrick表示，若拜登上任，为拿下一次获得两党支持的纪录，一项大规模基础设施支出计划可能会成为拜登政府的早期优先事项。\n\n花旗分析师Andrew Kaplowitz认为，拜登的计划将提振种类众多的工程和建筑公司，最大的受益者包括AECOMACM.N、Jacobs Engineering Group J.N和MasTec MTZ。\n\n关税贸易：拜登政府或许可以让美中关税战争平息下来。Ameriprise Financial首席市场策略师David Joy表示:“如果贸易政策不那么注重动用关税，进口商和出口商都可能受益。”\n\n摩根大通在7月的一份报告中指出，如果拜登当选总统导致美中关税紧张局势“缓和”，包括宝洁PG.N、Thermo Fisher TMO.N和3M MMM.N在内的众多个股可能跑赢大盘。\n\n**特朗普交易**\n\n税惠：拜登败选，意味着受益于特朗普减税措施的公司将享受到更多税惠。\n\n摩根大通7月报告指出，AT&T T.N、塔吉特(Target) TGT.N以及废物管理(Waste Management)WM.N等受益于特朗普减税和就业法案的公司，在拜登当选总统的情况下将会表现逊色。\n\n银行：在拜登当选的情况下，除了企业税负增加之外，银行还将面临监管收紧的问题，尤其是参议员沃伦(Elizabeth Warren)等激进人士得到重用的话。\n\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods(KBW)的分析师团队称，特朗普胜选且共和党保住参议院多数优势，是最有利于银行业的情形，因为“共和党拟放松监管的目标没有改变。”KBW建议在这种情况下可持有富国银行WFC.N、花旗集团C.N的股票。\n\n国防：BCA研究分析师团队在近期报告中称，特朗普将可能“在维持大规模国防支出方面取得成功，尽管民主党掌控着众议院，因为与中国和俄罗斯的角力是个现实问题。”\n\n化石燃料企业：据LPL的Detrick的观点，“支持能源企业，尤其是支持化石燃料企业似乎仍然是特朗普的目标。”他还补充称，除了再生能源企业之外，这个行业的多数企业，将可能因特朗普胜选而受益。(完)",

  "text": "路透9月25日 - 美国部分个股下周或更大幅波动，届时美国总统特朗普和对手拜登将举行大选前的首场辩论。博彩业目前认为两人胜选的机率基本各占一半。\n\n2020年3月9日，美国纽约，纽交所外的华尔街指示牌。REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\n拜登在周二的辩论中若表现突出，可能提振全球贸易和可再生能源相关个股；而特朗普在辩论中若占上风，则可能利好化石燃料和国防类股。\n\n这是三场辩论中的第一场，而此时华尔街正处于令人担忧的时刻。\n\n标普500指数最近几周较纪录高位已跌10%，投资者担心经济从新冠疫情中的漫长复苏，以及与11月3日大选相关的不确定性，其中包括可能推迟宣布胜选者。\n\nCresset Wealth Advisors首席投资官Jack Ablin指出，如果其中一位候选人在周二的辩论中显居上风，“这场辩论可能提供了个股和板块表现的机会。”\n\n“例如我认为，拜登胜选的话，苹果公司的日子可能比特朗普获胜要来得容易。”Ablin称，他提及特朗普与中国的贸易冲突。\n\n过去便有个别股票和其他资产易受到辩论结果造成的市场波动影响，即便更广泛的市场通常忽略这种结果。\n\n例如，根据密西根大学和达特茅斯学院一项研究，特朗普和希拉里克林顿2016年9月26日的辩论，造成墨西哥披索大涨2%，以及油价、金价、美国公债的波动。\n\n很多投资者认为拜登更有可能提高税收，认为倾向于放松监管的特朗普连任对整体股市更为有利。与此同时，特朗普胜选可能引发中美紧张关系升级的担忧。\n\n总统选举辩论后关注的股票\n\n若拜登表现突出可能利好的股票：\n\n公司 行业：\n\nTyler Technologies TYL.N 政府科技\n\nHMS Holdings HMSY.O 医疗创新\n\nMolina Healthcare MOH.N 医疗保险\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners BEP.N 清洁能源\n\nAECOM ACM.N 基础设施\n\nKansas City Southern KSU.N 全球贸易\n\n来源：Global Policy Index\n\n总统选举辩论后关注的股票\n\n若特朗普表现突出可能利好的股票：\n\n公司 行业\n\n西方石油(Occidental Petroleum) OXY.N 美国能源\n\nEnterprise Products Partners EPD.N 美国能源\n\n雷神(Raytheon) RTX.N 国防\n\n洛克希德马丁(Lockheed Martin) LMT.N 国防\n\nTurning Point Brands TPB.N 烟草\n\nEnova International ENVA.N 金融监管放松\n\n来源：Global Policy Index\n\n由于预计选票统计将推迟，期权市场显示，投资者为11和12月市场波动做好准备。特朗普周三拒绝承诺若败选会和平移交权力，并表示他预计选战最终将由最高法院来裁决。\n\n据RealClearPolitics，押注网站显示，拜登打败特朗普的胜率为53%，低于8月初的61%，这加大了政治不确定性。\n\nCornerstone Macro根据近期资产价格和选举胜率押注的统计对比分析，若拜登胜出，次日可能提振标普500指数.SPX上涨约1%，而特朗普赢得连任将拖累该指数下跌约4%。\n\n“对这个结果的一个可能的解读是，市场已愈发反映拜登将胜选，而相反的结果则构成一些风险，风险可能来自潜在的贸易紧张关系升级或是类似因素，”Cornerstone Marco写道。\n\n对冲基金Gullane Capital Partners LLC的合伙人Trip Miller说，他的公司目前正专注于观察每位总统候选人对它持有的特定股票可能产生的影响，而不是各个候选人对美股的整体影响。\n\n“拜登利好我们的一些持股，比如太阳能类股，而特朗普则利好其他一些能受益于监管较松的股票，”Miller说。\n\n瑞银本周的一份报告预测，特朗普连任将对医疗保健股影响很小。另一方面，如果拜登胜选，将只会带来温和的调整，而不会对医疗保险进行重大改革，哪怕民主党掌控参议院也不会这样做。(完)",

  "text": "路透班加罗尔9月28日 - 路透调查显示，主要国家主权债券实质收益率远低于零，对收益率很快转正的预期已经消散，因大规模货币宽松和资产购买计划还要持续很长时间。\n\n资料图片：2011年1月，欧元、美元、英镑和日圆等币种。REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\n\n十多年来，主要国家央行采用大规模货币政策工具来压低长期借款成本，以使信贷流动继续带动经济恢复更快增长，并推高通胀。\n\n由于新冠疫情爆发，美国10年期公债实质收益率今年跌至零以下，加入日本、德国和英国可比公债负收益率行列。过去10年多数时间这些公债的回报都是负值。\n\n尽管数年来路透调查一直错误地预期债券收益率会上升，但9月17-24日对逾100位固收分析师的调查显示，他们仍预计主要国家公债收益率一年内将上升20-30个基点左右。\n\n但这些债券经通胀调整后的实质收益率一年后料仍然是负值，尽管政府债务负担庞大且仍在增加举债。\n\n逾四分之三受访者，即75位中的57位，称主权债收益率最可能的情况是保持在当前水准左右，或者区间波动--距离今年低位不是很远，但远低于疫情前水准。\n\n这在很大程度上是反映低通胀预期和主要央行承诺保持近零利率甚至负利率；以及预期当前的购债计划到期后将持续实施。\n\n“尽管忧心债券发行量赶不上持续强劲的债券需求，但我们仍预计债券收益率将受到压抑、被央行的低利率政策压低，”荷兰合作银行首席宏观分析师Elwin de Groot说。\n\n“人们总说，政府援助的需求是增加发债的原因，因此会造成利率上升，但目前为止这并非我们看到的模式。这是因为各地央行扮演重要角色，无论发行了多少债券，这些央行政策又将之抽离市场。”\n\n美国10年期公债收益率预料一年后上升超过25个基点至0.93%，是平均预期通胀率的一半，暗示这未来一年实质报酬将呈现负值。\n\n路透调查：美债收益率前景图表\n\ntmsnrt.rs/3jeLWzW\n\n对于未来12月的平均预估创下调查进行逾20年以来的最低，反映出美国联邦储备委员会(FED/美联储)近期调整政策以容忍通胀过热一段时间，且将在未来几年将维持利率于低档。\n\n45位受访者中有35位、也就是近八成分析师表示，美联储承诺多年近零利率的承诺，将令主要政府公债收益率维持在“低档”。只有约20%的受访者这将无法阻止“公债收益率上行”。\n\n这样的看法与另一项路透调查中汇市分析师的预期相呼应，汇市分析师多认为逾两年来美元强势的最大因素--利差诱因--已经转淡，这反映在美联储宣布调整政策后美国资产收益率下滑。\n\n今年美元下跌激励新兴市场货币和公债，最新调查预计未来12个月这种趋势将维持不变，尽管这些国家的举债增幅创纪录。\n\n37位分析师中，有逾50%认为未来一年新兴市场经济体的公债遭到抛售的风险最大。近40%的受访者称公司债面临的风险最大，不到10%的受访者称主要发达经济体主权债风险最大。\n\n路透调查：主要国家公债收益率前景\n\ntmsnrt.rs/333qxV4\n\n欧洲央行、日本央行和英国央行牵头实施的大规模货币刺激举措料将持续至今年以后，最新调查预计德国、日本和英国债券的实质收益率将为负值。\n\n低利率最终将刺激价格压力的普遍观点尚未成为现实，这突显出这样一种观点：多年来未能实现通胀目标的多数主要央行，在未来许多年都将难以实现这一目标。\n\n“我们作为一个经济社会，需要对我们理解通胀的能力保持谦虚，”Janney Montgomery Scott首席固定收益策略师Guy LeBas表示。(完)",

Hall周日稍早称，该项行政禁令“史无前例”而且“没有理由”。\n\n“磋商正在进行，(谈成了)这项禁令就没有必要了，而在今晚就实施禁令怎么能是合理的？”Hall在听证会中说。“这不过是一种惩罚，只是打击公司的一种直接方式...现在根本没必要那么着急。”\n\n中国官媒乐见美国法官的裁决。\n\n环球时报总编辑胡锡进周一在推特上表示，“我认为这符合道德、正义、及常识。”\n\n中国官媒已经表示，他们认为中国没有批准交易的理由，形容这起交易是基于“霸凌与勒索”。\n\n特朗普政府的官员认为TikTok对美国构成国家安全忧虑，担心使用该应用的1亿美国用户的个人数据可能被中国政府获得。而且任何交易仍将接受美国外资审议委员会(CFIUS)的审查。\n\n美国司法部称，允许美国人继续下载TikTok应用的初步禁止令将“干涉到总统对于国家安全问题的一项正式判断，改变正在进行的CFIUS研议；并继续允许涉及到所有新用户的敏感和有价值用户信息流向字节跳动。”\n\n宾夕法尼亚州的另一位法官周六驳回了三位TikTok内容开发者阻止政府禁令的尝试，而加州的一位法官则阻止了一项要求腾讯控股0700.HK的WeChat在美国应用商店下架的类似命令生效。(完)",

  "text": "路透北京9月28日 - 中国银行研究院周一发布报告预计，预计三季度中国GDP（国内生产总值）增长5.1%左右，随后经济将进入复苏的平台期，增长动能将有所放缓，四季度GDP增速为5.6%左右；宏观政策要提前关注和应对经济金融领域存在的多种风险，在稳增长和防风险之间取得平衡。\n\n该团队在2020年四季度经济金融展望报告中指出，尽管经济复苏逐步接近正常水平，但经济金融领域存在的诸多风险点值得特别关注，如新冠疫情倒灌、政经格局巨变和全球经济复苏艰难等外部风险，国内逆周期调节政策效应衰减、高杠杆风险，以及地方债务、银行贷款和债券违约等信用风险。\n\n“宽松货币政策能够在短期内迅速见效，推动经济尽快走出困境，但经济的行稳致远不能仅依赖货币政策刺激，需要市场化行为推动才能确保经济复苏后的可持续增长。”报告称。\n\n报告强调，从长远看，全球疫情“大流行”何时减弱和消除，全球经济内生动力不足，中美关系受经贸摩擦、美国大选及其他非经济因素的影响程度等，都为中国经济带来了变数。\n\n考虑到稳增长仍是未来较长时期内经济工作的重点，报告建议，把握降准、降息节奏，继续推动企业融资成本下行；合理利用法定存款准备金率等货币政策工具，通过控制操作频率，根据经济复苏及企业融资情况择机降准、降息，推动企业综合融资成本继续下降。\n\n“当前，适度宽松的货币政策不宜退出，为避免市场误解政策取向，政策制定部门和监管部门需建立更高频次的沟通机制或常态化的沟通渠道，”报告称，政策部门应及时回应市场关切，对流动性投放信息提前向市场“吹风”。\n\n要增加国债发行规模，适度提高中央政府杠杆率，拓宽财政资金来源；加大长期限流动性供给，确保国债平稳发行，建议央行根据国债发行规模和期限，通过滚动续期的方式加大流动性，尤其是MLF等。\n\n**中美利差大概率再扩大**\n\n为应对疫情冲击，主要经济体央行相继推出了低利率+量化宽松政策，全球资产收益率迅速走低，中外利差不断扩大。报告指出，二季度以来，中国经济复苏速度加快，若美国经济不能尽快反弹，将导致内外利差进一步扩大，外部资本流入速度加快可能会对中国的金融稳定带来影响。\n\n由于全球疫情尚未得到有效控制，今年8月美联储宣布将采用更具弹性的通胀目标，这意味着美联储货币政策后续可能仍有大幅阶段性放松的空间，中美利差再次扩大是大概率事件。\n\n报告建议加强资本流动监测，防控资本套利，灵活引导汇率波动，要加强资本流动管理，避免套利资金大幅流入。在中国金融开放加速背景下，资本与金融项目可兑换速度也将加快，但自由可兑换并不等于不管理。\n\n“中国要采取适当的资本流动管理政策，建立更为完善的监控体系，加强对资本流入的甄别，避免投机性资本的过度涌入，催生金融市场泡沫。”报告称。\n\n其次，要采取对称性的汇率管理机制，防范汇率持续升值。汇率持续快速升值会影响中国出口，不利于经济恢复。报告建议对汇率采取对称性的管理措施，适时启动逆周期调节因子，防范市场羊群效应，稳定中国出口增速，助力经济复苏。（完）",

  "text": "路透旧金山/华盛顿/纽约9月23日 - 在中国字节跳动加紧与甲骨文ORCL.N和沃尔玛WMT.N达成一项协议，以便让其视频分享应用程序TikTok继续在美国运营之际，一个明显的突破是上周三与美国财政部官员的通话。\n\n资料图片：2019年11月，美国国旗上手机屏幕显示的TikTok标识。REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\n字节跳动的一名高级律师在通话中表示，字节跳动将同意美国外资审议委员会(CFIUS)提出的条款。由财长努钦(Steven Mnuchin)领导的CFIUS审查交易是否存在潜在的国家安全风险。美国官员担心最多1亿美国TikTok用户的个人数据可能会被传递给中国政府。\n\n努钦的企图并没有成功。字节跳动随后宣布一项协议，根据该协议，TikTok仍将是其子公司。这与甲骨文和沃尔玛的说法相矛盾，甲骨文和沃尔玛曾表示，TikTok的多数股东将是美国人。\n\n字节跳动的协议版本还将无视特朗普总统上月的行政令，该行政令要求总部位于北京的字节跳动放弃TikTok在美国的所有权。\n\n四位熟悉该谈判的不愿具名消息人士解释道，特朗普周六宣布的关于TikTok的初步协议仍存在争议。\n\n由于字节跳动和TikTok的求购者谋求达成一份美中两国政府都可能批准的协议，这笔价值可能超过500亿美元的社交媒体业历来规模最大的交易中，关键因素并未在一份综合合同中详细说明。这类合同通常在涉及高风险合并的交易时会见到。\n\n取而代之的是，这些公司被要求火速原则上同意一份CFIUS对字节跳动四天前呈交提案的20页修订版本，其中以红色字体满满标记。如果字节跳动到周日都达不成协议，美国商务部将阻止TikTok的下载和更新。\n\n甲骨文和美国财政部不予置评。字节跳动和沃尔玛未立即回应置评要求。\n\n特朗普周五得到甲骨文和沃尔玛保证，将在TikTok创造25,000个新就业岗位，并启动一项针对儿童的教育计划。特朗普决定自己宣布该交易，没有起草协议，也没有关于中国参与方式的计划。\n\n在最高法案大法官金斯伯格去世后，他将交易宣布时间推迟到周六。\n\n特朗普提供的细节很少，沃尔玛和甲骨文均发布公告，介绍它们所理解的交易关键条款。之后字节跳动于周一就该交易发表声明，与甲骨文和沃尔玛的声明相矛盾。\n\n各方同意，甲骨文将持有TikTok Global 12.5%的股份，沃尔玛将持股7.5%。但剩余80%股份的归属仍存在争议。TikTok Global是新创立的美国公司，将包括TikTok的全球业务，并在其云上存储美国用户数据。\n\n字节跳动表示，在TikTok Global未来12个月启动首次公开发行(IPO)之前，其将持有TikTok Global的80%股权，随后将逐步减持。\n\n甲骨文周一表示，字节跳动将不会持有TikTok Global的股权，剩余80%的股权将由字节跳动的投资者获得。特朗普政府的一些官员，甚至字节跳动的一个主要投资人私下里也是这样描述这笔交易的。\n\n这一分歧可能足以使这笔交易流产。如果字节跳动保留多数股权，这将意味着白宫态度的一个重大转变。如果字节跳动得不到TikTok Global的股权，这对中国将是一个打击。中国官员一直反对出售TikTok这一字节跳动最宝贵的资产之一。\n\n“字节跳动和甲骨文给出的不同信息反映出，要想同时取悦华盛顿和北京是很难做到的，”监管事务律师John Kabealo说。他并未参与讨论。\n\n**周日大限**\n\n协议中的矛盾描述究竟是因为条款模棱两可，还是因为字节跳动想要缓解中国对其屈服于美国的疑虑，目前仍不得而知。该协议还需要CFIUS进一步审查。\n\n甲骨文和字节跳动都努力想把围绕TikTok Global所有权的歧见降低至最小，其中一个方法就是强调这家新公司的大多数权益将由美国人拥有。字节跳动目前有约41%投资者来自美国。算上美国人的间接持股，再加上甲骨文及沃尔玛的直接持股，字节跳动便可以宣称TikTok Global的所有权是由多数美国人持有，即便字节跳动拥有其80%股份。\n\n时间一分一秒过去。美国商务部已将最终协议的达成期限延后至周日，如果还不能达成协议，TikTok就必须在美国的应用商店下架。两位消息人士说，协议可能无法及时完成，公司方可能会要求再次延期。\n\nTikTok Global的所有权并不是唯一需要摆平的问题。虽然CFIUS已经批准了一项关于甲骨文如何存储美国用户数据和检查TikTok源代码的总体计划，但诸如安全问题修补等具体协议仍然付之阙如。(完)",

  "text": "（重发以修饰第一段措辞）\n\n2020年9月15日，美国卡尔弗城，TikTok美国总部外的标识。REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n路透9月22日 - 当交易人士对谁将真正拥有TikTok Global争论不休之际，在美国总统特朗普上周末同意将这个广受欢迎的视频共享应用在美国的下载禁令推迟一周后，又浮现了另一个问题：他们如何在美国创造25,000个新工作岗位？\n\n特朗普周六在北卡罗来纳州的一场竞选集会上重申了这样的承诺，这也说服特朗普放行交易的部分原因。交易人士称，由美国公民组成的新董事会将监督新公司TikTok Global。这家位于美国的新公司将由甲骨文ORCL.N和沃尔玛WMT.N共同拥有。\n\n但专家们表示，招聘目标有些高不可攀。如此高的数字表明，在TikTok面临前所未有的全球挑战之际，预期营收仍会大幅增长。\n\n如果TikTok的运营效率要接近推特TWTR.N等其他互联网公司，那么TikTok将需要在未来几年将营收最多增加19倍。\n\nWedbush Securities科技分析师Dan Ives说，由于美国政府特别在意TikTok的数据隐私政策，这些在美国新增的岗位可能是工程、内容审核和安全等职位。\n\n“从安全和基础设备角度而言，考虑到敏感性，他们势必得聘雇几千人专注在这个问题上，”他说。\n\nTikTok最近刚宣布了一项10亿美元创作者基金，将付费给受欢迎的TikTok网红制作视频。广告商GroupM的商业智能全球总裁Brian Wieser说，把这些内容创作者计入，TikTok创造的岗位就能达到25,000个。\n\n除此之外，难以找到更多的岗位需求。由于字节跳动仍将拥有运营TikTok的算法并将其授权给这个总部在美国的新公司，后者将不需要聘雇庞大团队来从事人工智能的工作。\n\n科技与地缘政治谘询公司Center for Innovating the Future(CIF)的未来学家Abishur Prakash说，这类岗位在Facebook Inc FB.O和推特都占了很大一部分的人力，将会引发关于TikTok会招聘哪些岗位的疑问。\n\n他补充说，甲骨文和沃尔玛也可能在公司内部成立部门，为TikTok提供服务，从而有助于创造就业。\n\n一位熟悉交易磋商的消息人士表示，25,000的就业数字是基于对与TikTok用户一样多的规模类似的组织估算的，但未具体说明。这位消息人士并称，该就业数字实际上是保守的，意在少承诺多兑现。\n\n另一家科技公司--台湾鸿海2017年承诺在威斯康辛州筹建一家新厂，创造13,000个就业岗位。特朗普将这项协议称为“世界第八大奇迹”，并将此作为他有能力让就业岗位回到美国的证据。\n\n据CNBC报导，提交给威斯康辛州经济发展部门的一份文件显示，鸿海2019年在该州聘雇约600人。\n\n**同行对比评估**\n\n与其他互联网企业员工创造的营收相比，就能更好地理解TikTok招聘目标的野心有多大了。\n\n推特的4,800名员工2019年每人平均创造近72万美元营收，或等于总年度营收35亿美元。SnapSNAP.N的3,195名员工2019年每人平均创收约53.7万美元，年度总营收为17亿美元。\n\n路透此前曾报导，字节跳动目前的美国员工超过1,000名，多数在加州，一些在德克萨斯州等其他地方。\n\n按相似的效率水平，TikTok的26,000名美国新员工总数能创造的年营收预计为140亿至190亿美元。\n\nPrakash表示，即便取较低数值，这样的营收目标对于TikTok也很难实现。\n\n“我们处在TikTok发展中的不同阶段...有着许多包袱，”Prakash说。他还表示，TikTok在印度仍然被禁，而印度原本是TikTok最大的市场。“想要实现140多亿美元(营收)，所需时间会长很多，难度也会大很多。”(完)",

  "text": "路透伦敦9月23日 - 在电子和算法交易主宰汇市的时代，面对激烈竞争的成本，许多银行业者纷纷将部份外汇业务转为外包，这个趋势或将更加巩固大型银行主导全球汇市交易的优势。\n\n资料图片：2016年1月，中国北京，美元、欧元、英镑、人民币、日圆和港元等币种。REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\n在每日交易量高达6.6万亿美元的全球外汇市场上，小鱼依赖大鱼取得最佳价格及流动性，这种非正式的合作默契早已行之有年。但随着高科技交易大幅提升市场争夺最快速度及最优价格的竞争，银行同业之间建立更正式的合作关系正逐渐成为常态。\n\n由于外汇对企业客户极为重要，几乎没有一家银行会选择大幅缩减外汇业务，不像他们能够削减股票业务那样。许多银行选择退出无力竞争但仍希望向客户销售产品的领域。\n\n“英国和欧洲银行业者不得不聚焦于自己的优势领域，如此一来不可避免的结果就是要寻找合作伙伴。将一些(外汇交易)业务外包出去自然而然变得很合理，”NatWest Markets外汇交易主管Simon Manwaring称。\n\n外汇业务外包的形式众多，像是由数家其他银行提供流动性，或是订立较正式的协议，依赖某一特定机构提供特定货币，或是在交易日的特定时段提供协助等等。\n\n外包占NatWest交易量的一小部分，Manwaring表示，对于该行在地理上涉足很少的货币和时区而言，这是合理的。\n\n由于外汇市场的不透明性，这种操作的规模不大可能得到衡量。这种操作通常被称为白标，因为终端客户总是与他们自己的银行交易或对其拥有敞口。\n\n但显而易见的是，交易变得愈发集中，Coalition的数据显示，五家最大银行在外汇市场所占份额今年上半年升至41%，2016年时为37%。\n\n瑞典北欧斯安银行(SEB)外汇部门全球主管Svante Hedin对路透表示，该银行靠其他银行供应新兴市场货币流动性、特定外汇期权产品，并帮助执行计算机算法交易，并称科技的进步加速了外包服务。\n\n这种转变背后的其他因素还包括，利润率萎缩、欧洲实行《金融工具市场指令II》(MiFID II)监管举措等。该举措要求银行和投资者确保为客户提供最有利的执行价格。\n\n市场参与方指出，现在通过第三方交易分析对外汇交易费用进行评估，要比五年前容易得多。\n\n**与银行竞争**\n\n有人说业务外包将进一步强化大银行对市场的控制。不过大银行对此不以为然，表示他们的优势和信誉令其能够以最安全的方式向客户提供最合适的价格。\n\n不过还有一些难关需要克服。行业内部人士称，相关讨论经常无果而终，而两家机构之间要达成正式协议尤为艰难，因为银行与客户对于排他性安排会变得犹豫不决。这种安排会限制他们与其他机构交易的能力。\n\n与此同时，新出现的电子做市平台，如Citadel Securities和XTX Markets也与银行展开激烈竞争，尽管他们的业务基本上限制在现汇交易。\n\nCitadel Securities的eFX全球主管Kevin Kimmel表示，做市商必须展现出“卓越的执行质量”，以便让那些因提供不具竞争力价格而面临声誉风险的银行能够放心地向客户提供这些价格。\n\n新进业者在多交易商交易平台与银行直接竞争，并提供外包合作，以便银行能利用他们的流动性。\n\n一位知情人士透露，Citadel Securities今年增加了与银行建立白色标签合作关系的数量，而XTX最近推出了一种面向投资者、银行和交易平台的外汇执行算法。\n\n接下来呢？尽管最近有所增长，不过外汇业务外包仍然有限。但是汇丰控股全球中介服务主管Vincent Bonamy认为，未来可能会达成更多、更广泛的协议。\n\n“有趣的是，市场上不同的企业可能会向更广泛的外包领域扩张，”他称，“不只是分销，还可能涉及外汇结算和执行。”(完)",

  "text": "路透北京9月28日 - 中国银行研究院周一发布报告预计，预计三季度中国GDP（国内生产总值）增长5.1%左右，随后经济将进入复苏的平台期，增长动能将有所放缓，四季度GDP增速为5.6%左右；宏观政策要提前关注和应对经济金融领域存在的多种风险，在稳增长和防风险之间取得平衡。\n\n该团队在2020年四季度经济金融展望报告中指出，尽管经济复苏逐步接近正常水平，但经济金融领域存在的诸多风险点值得特别关注，如新冠疫情倒灌、政经格局巨变和全球经济复苏艰难等外部风险，国内逆周期调节政策效应衰减、高杠杆风险，以及地方债务、银行贷款和债券违约等信用风险。\n\n“宽松货币政策能够在短期内迅速见效，推动经济尽快走出困境，但经济的行稳致远不能仅依赖货币政策刺激，需要市场化行为推动才能确保经济复苏后的可持续增长。”报告称。\n\n报告强调，从长远看，全球疫情“大流行”何时减弱和消除，全球经济内生动力不足，中美关系受经贸摩擦、美国大选及其他非经济因素的影响程度等，都为中国经济带来了变数。\n\n考虑到稳增长仍是未来较长时期内经济工作的重点，报告建议，把握降准、降息节奏，继续推动企业融资成本下行；合理利用法定存款准备金率等货币政策工具，通过控制操作频率，根据经济复苏及企业融资情况择机降准、降息，推动企业综合融资成本继续下降。\n\n“当前，适度宽松的货币政策不宜退出，为避免市场误解政策取向，政策制定部门和监管部门需建立更高频次的沟通机制或常态化的沟通渠道，”报告称，政策部门应及时回应市场关切，对流动性投放信息提前向市场“吹风”。\n\n要增加国债发行规模，适度提高中央政府杠杆率，拓宽财政资金来源；加大长期限流动性供给，确保国债平稳发行，建议央行根据国债发行规模和期限，通过滚动续期的方式加大流动性，尤其是MLF等。\n\n**中美利差大概率再扩大**\n\n为应对疫情冲击，主要经济体央行相继推出了低利率+量化宽松政策，全球资产收益率迅速走低，中外利差不断扩大。报告指出，二季度以来，中国经济复苏速度加快，若美国经济不能尽快反弹，将导致内外利差进一步扩大，外部资本流入速度加快可能会对中国的金融稳定带来影响。\n\n由于全球疫情尚未得到有效控制，今年8月美联储宣布将采用更具弹性的通胀目标，这意味着美联储货币政策后续可能仍有大幅阶段性放松的空间，中美利差再次扩大是大概率事件。\n\n报告建议加强资本流动监测，防控资本套利，灵活引导汇率波动，要加强资本流动管理，避免套利资金大幅流入。在中国金融开放加速背景下，资本与金融项目可兑换速度也将加快，但自由可兑换并不等于不管理。\n\n“中国要采取适当的资本流动管理政策，建立更为完善的监控体系，加强对资本流入的甄别，避免投机性资本的过度涌入，催生金融市场泡沫。”报告称。\n\n其次，要采取对称性的汇率管理机制，防范汇率持续升值。汇率持续快速升值会影响中国出口，不利于经济恢复。报告建议对汇率采取对称性的管理措施，适时启动逆周期调节因子，防范市场羊群效应，稳定中国出口增速，助力经济复苏。（完）",

  "text": "路透香港9月23日 - 经济学人智库发表报告称，受地缘政治紧张局势和安全考虑驱动，亚洲主要新兴经济体均转向内在发展。其中中国因与美国外交和贸易关系恶化，加深了其经济自给自足的需要，并提出“双循环”促进内需。\n\n然而，中国在2008-09年金融危机时亦提出过增内需，但过去10年私人消费占GDP比重仅轻微增加，显示在新目标下扩大内需的努力更要加大。\n\n报告表示，金融危机期间中国政府提出致力扩大内需，因当时由出口推动的增长模式显示出其局限性。然而，尽管随后投资大增，但家庭支出的增长则缓慢。去年内地私人消费占GDP的比重为38.8%，仅略高于10年前。今年疫情大流行，私人消费更将成为经济表现最差的部分。\n\n经济学人智库指出，对中国而言，私人消费是实现可持续经济增长的最佳渠道，这也源于政府感到外部环境有重大变化。中美贸易战及一些国家希望减少对中国供应链的依赖表明，未来中国进入海外市场的机会将会减少。\n\n双循环的另一个关键因素将是减少与进口依赖相关的风险。因中国的国际关系恶化趋势，当局关注国际粮食、能源和技术供应的安全。即使这样做会影响到某些经济效率下降，但预防风险和国家安全的必要性将胜过“高质量增长”。\n\n至于双循环在中国将如何发挥作用，报告认为，在产业政策方面，预计政策目标是使国内供应链更符合国内需求的结构。这与备受争议的“中国制造2025”倡议的更大范围目标相反，该倡议旨在确保多个新兴板块的全球市场份额。双循环下的产业政策和支持并不着眼于促进出口，而是把重点放在中国被视为严重依赖进口的瓶颈上。\n\n在所有板块中，技术板块应会是在实现自我供给方面获得最大支持的领域，其中半导体或集成电路（IC）最受关注，因美国通过出口管制限制中国取得全球技术，这对华为及其他中国科技公司带来压力。\n\n报告称，尽管内地通过启动投资、为IC生产企业提供税优惠、加强科研等政策支持产业发展，但对中国公司来说，要赶上台湾、韩国和美国等竞争对手仍将是一大挑战。因要在这领域取得进展，就需要发展产业生态并培养广泛人才基础，通过海外并购加速国内技术板块升级，亦因更严格的监督而变更具挑战性。\n\n**能源与粮食**\n\n在能源方面，经济学人智库指出，去年中国石油消费量近85%来自进口，沙特阿拉伯和俄罗斯是其最大的石油供应国，中国较少依赖美国及其同盟国。然而，人们担心可能的运输中断，包括经过地缘政治紧张局势加剧的南中国海航道。\n\n培育中国国内能源最有希望的途径仍然是可再生能源，这占去年能源消耗近20%。中国在可再生能源的回报率相对于其他国家仍然较高，而管网连通性的问题也正稳步改善。\n\n在可再生能源领域中，报告认为风能和核能将会优先考虑。目前海上风电仍未开发，未来可能会获得沿海省份的投资。在核能领域，中国在建或正待批的12家电厂将使用本地技术，而非美国或其他地区的技术。\n\n在粮食方面，报告称中国目前依赖进口大豆满足国内需求，但中国社会科学院预测到2025年，内地小麦、玉米和大米的产量短缺将达2,500万吨。粮食供应直接影响消费者价格，有可能影响社会稳定。\n\n不过报告认为，中国仍有很大的余地扩大粮食生产以弥补缺口，中国的农业仍为劳动密集生产，因此通过现代化和技术提高产量的空间很大。\n\n然而，农村土地改革缓慢窒碍了进展，故此对进口依赖将继续存在。根据今年初的中美贸易协议，美国农民短期仍将享有一些机会，但长远而言，中国希望保持供应多元化，这将为欧洲、拉丁美洲和“一带一路”沿线的农业带来机会。\n\n经济学人智库并表示，亚洲经济体转向内在发展这一转折表示全球一体化程度的回落，但区内国家仍将为外国投资者提供巨大的商业机会。随着运营本地化的趋势加剧，对全球投资者来说，管理其本土市场的政治压力并同时把握亚洲机遇，将愈来愈具挑战性。（完）",

  "text": "（作者为工银国际首席经济学家程实和资深经济学家钱智俊，本文仅代表其个人观点。）\n\n资料图片：2014年5月，北京，一家饭店的服务员身着传统服饰迎接顾客登门。REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\n“积土成山，风雨兴焉。”面向中国经济的高质量发展，“以国内大循环为主体”不仅意味着扩大内需的“量变”，更指向了内需动力模式的“质变”。在此前以“外循环”为主导的发展阶段，中国经济长期沿循“对接国际需求→制造业加大投资”的需求传导链条。这一链条虽然拉动了内需规模的高增长，但是也引致了投资占比过高、居民消费不足等结构性失衡。更为重要的是，内需的源动力仍然较多依赖国际市场，因此本质上是“伪内需”模式。\n\n以2015年供给侧改革为起点，以“双循环”建设为机遇期，当前中国经济加速走向“真内需”模式，“国内市场扩大→制造业加大投资”的新链条正在形成，有望在夯实内需韧性的同时，持续激活消费、投资协同增长的长远潜力。基于此，我们预测，至2035年，中国内需的实际规模有望较2019年实现倍增，内需结构料将多重优化，进而为畅通“内循环”奠定坚实的需求侧基础。\n\n**内需的现状：增速有优势，结构有短板**\n\n鉴于当前国内外形势，对中国内需的研究亟待注重两个要点。其一，全球百年未有之大变局与中国经济高质量发展相互交叠，前瞻中国内需的长期远景，需要充分结合时代趋势与国情演进。其二，针对内需的跨国比较宜尽量剔除通胀影响，以便揭示真实需求的演化，这在疫情时代全球货币政策超宽松的背景下尤为重要。沿循上述思路，我们发现，目前中国内需在“全球-历史”大坐标系下呈现两大特征。\n\n第一，增速较快。从成分视角来看，无论是中国的投资内需，还是消费内需，在全球视野下均长期保有增长优势。就投资而言，1996-2019年中国资本形成总额实际同比增速的年度均值为11.4%，较同期全球、中等偏上收入经济体和OECD成员的平均水平，分别高出8.0个、4.3个和9.1个百分点。就消费而言，1996-2019年中国最终消费实际同比增速的年度均值为9.4%，较同期全球、中等偏上收入经济体和OECD成员的平均水平，分别高出6.6个、4.5个和7.3个百分点。基于此，1996年至2019年，中国内需总量的实际同比增速中枢为10.1%，大幅领先同期全球、中等偏上收入经济体和OECD成员的平均水平，增速优势分别高达7.2个、5.2个和8.0个百分点。得益于长期较快增长，至2019年中国内需规模已扩大至12.6万亿美元，约为美国内需规模的57%、欧盟的84%，以及日本的1.7倍。\n\n第二，结构失衡。从结构视角来看，至2019年中国内需依然存在逐层递进的三重失衡。一是消费投资比例失衡。2019年，在中国内需总量中，消费需求占比仅为65.0%，而美国、欧元区和日本的比例则分别高达94.2%、76.8%和75.6%。二是居民消费发育不足。在中国消费总量中，居民消费的占比仅为70.0%，较美国（83.0%）、日本（73.4%）和欧元区（72.2%）仍有差距。三是服务消费占比过低。根据发达国家的历史经验，随着经济社会的发展，居民消费重心从商品消费转向服务消费是大势所趋。至2019年，美国和日本的服务消费占居民消费比重分别达到69.0%和60.6%，而中国仅为49.5%。有鉴于此，未来用好中国超大规模市场优势，激活居民消费潜力，加速服务消费发展，有望成为中国强化内需引擎的结构性重点。\n\n值得强调的是，虽然发达国家的普遍经验提供了内需结构的方向性指引，但是其具体比例并非“金科玉律”。事实上，从发达国家的历史教训来看，若内需结构过度“重消费、轻投资”，将造成产业空心化、消费杠杆高企等弊端。若消费重心过度“重个人、轻政府”，也易形成公共品供给不足、贫富差距过大等弊端。在当前全球乱局之下，疫情冲击导致弱势群体受到非对称压力，数字经济的加速发展形成新一轮投资缺口，或将放大上述弊端。因此，未来中国内需结构的调整不宜对照发达国家亦步亦趋，而应根据自身特征和时代趋势寻求最优解。\n\n**内需的变革：模式正切换，潜力长可期**\n\n从时序视角来看，2001年、2015年是中国内需动力模式的两大历史性转折点。2001年至2014年，投资内需一方面在增速上长期高于消费内需，同比实际增速的年均差值高达5.3个百分点；另一方面在波动方向上与消费内需背离，多次出现此消彼长的走势。这一现象的背后逻辑是中国加入WTO并快速融入“国际大循环”，形成了“对接国际需求→制造业加大投资”的传导链条，因此这种投资内需的高增长本质上仍具有较强的外部依赖性，在一定意义上是“伪内需”。2015年至今，消费内需增速领先投资内需，并且两者增速差明显收窄、走势逐步趋同。其背后逻辑是2015年供给侧改革加快推动过剩产能出清，供求结构重新匹配优化，正在形成“国内市场扩大→制造业加大投资”的新链条，内需增长的内生性和稳定性增强，是“真内需”。从“伪内需”向“真内需”的模式切换，虽然在表面上引致了增速的阶段性走弱，但是深层隐含着内需韧性的增强。\n\n当前全球遭逢百年未有之大变局，叠加中国“双循环”格局的构建，料将推动“真内需”模式的加速发展。以此为基础，中国有望进一步形成“国内市场扩大→制造业加大投资→居民就业收入改善→国内市场持续扩大”的内需发展机制，为畅通“内循环”奠定坚实的需求侧基础。在全球视野下，中国超大规模市场蕴藏着充沛的消费潜力，有望为上述机制提供稳健的源动力。\n\n在宏观层面，结构性抑制有望逐步消解。此前中国作为“供给中心”嵌入全球体系，形成了“重生产、轻消费”的经济结构，对消费内需造成显著抑制。至2018年，中国居民创造了全球GDP产值的16.1%，但仅享受了全球消费的12.1%，“产出占比-消费占比”剪刀差高达4.0%。相较而言，美国、日本、欧盟、全球高收入经济体以及OECD成员的剪刀差水平均低至负值，即使是中等收入经济体的均值水平也较中国略低。未来在“双循环”格局下，随着中国升级为全球“供给-需求”双中心，这一结构性的抑制有望缓解，进而释放消费潜力。\n\n在微观层面，长期动力有望渐次加强。虽然当前中国具有超大规模市场，但是细分至人均水平，无论是消费能力（人均国民总收入GNI），还是消费意愿（人均居民消费占人均GNI的比例），均在全球位于中低水平，不仅远低于OECD成员均值，甚至还略落后于中等偏上收入经济体均值，因此仍具有广阔的提升空间。未来得益于中国新型城镇化的推进、中产阶层的壮大、年轻世代的崛起以及数字经济的发展，居民消费升级向质量高度、市场深度、产品广度的“三维”拓展将是长期趋势。由此，叠加居民收入的稳步提升，消费意愿和消费能力有望同步改善，为消费引擎注入长期动力。\n\n**内需的前景：规模将倍增，结构再优化**\n\n2020年至2035年是中国基本实现社会主义现代化的关键阶段。根据我们之前研究，这一时期预计也将是“双循环”新格局确立并畅通运行、中国完全迈过“中等收入陷阱”的历史阶段。以2035年为目标时点，基于本文的上述分析，可以在“全球-历史”的宏观大坐标系下进一步推测中国内需的长远前景。\n\n从规模来看，内需倍增是大概率事件。\n\n我们采用两种方法推算当前至2035年的中国内需规模变动，并进行相互验证。第一，增速递推法。我们预计，在保守情景下，2020-2035年中国经济年度实际同比增速的长期中枢为4.5%左右。假设这一阶段的经济增长主要由内需驱动，在剔除了通胀对于投资、消费名义规模的影响之后，那么2035年内需的实际规模预计约为2019年内需规模的2倍。第二，收入比例法。2019年中国人均GNI升至10410美元，略低于高收入国家的门槛值（12535美元）。我们预计，在保守情景下，即使未来中国人均GNI的实际同比增速明显低于趋势水平，至2035年中国人均GNI也将大概率迈入高收入经济体行列，并触及16700美元（2019年购买力）。由此，再假设中国人均GNI中用于消费的比例向OECD成员水平趋近，内需中投资、消费的结构比例向欧洲、日本趋近，则2035年中国内需规模亦将较2019年实现倍增（剔除通胀影响后）。\n\n基于上述两种预测方法，2019-2035年中国内需实际规模的倍增将是大概率事件。此外，若这一目标如期兑现，那么至21世纪中叶，中国有望取代美国成为全球实际需求最大的居民消费市场（剔除通胀影响后）。\n\n从结构来看，三层次优化有望实现。\n\n其一，内生增长模式确立。至2035年，中国内需对经济增长贡献率的长期中枢预计将接近100%。但是，这并不等于“闭关自守”。随着中国升级为全球“供给-需求”双中心，以及高水平开放的不断扩大，中国对外贸易有望走向均衡状态，在小幅顺差和小幅逆差之间弹性波动。由此，“外循环”对“内循环”的增长贡献，不再主要反映于净出口的数据高低，而是主要体现于国际国内要素加快流动、优化配置所实现的全要素生产率提升。\n\n其二，消费、投资合理搭配。至2035年，在消费市场扩大的同时，中国料仍将持续以新基建投资、产业投资促进供给侧升级，加速拥抱新一轮技术革命。由此，我们预计，至2035年，中国内需结构不会走向“美国模式”，而是有望更接近日本与欧元区：消费占国民经济的比重约为75%，投资的占比约为25%。\n\n其三，个人、政府比例协调。中国作为幅员辽阔、区域发展差异较大的后发经济体，仍需要政府发力推动公共服务均等化、区域发展协同化。在全球疫情时代，进一步夯实公共卫生防疫体系和社会保障体系，也是应有之义。因此，未来在中国居民消费较快发展的同时，政府消费料将稳步增长、提质增效。至2035年，中国居民消费占最终消费的比例或不会过度抬升，预计将稳定在72%左右，以实现个人福利和社会公益的总体平衡。（完）",

REUTERS/Sergio Pérez\n\n“La Sala II del Tribunal Supremo ha confirmado la condena al presidente de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Joaquim Torra, a 1 año y 6 meses de inhabilitación especial y multa de 30.000 euros por un delito de desobediencia ... al considerar que desobedeció de forma reiterada y contumaz las órdenes de la Junta Electoral Central para que retirase determinada simbología de edificios públicos dependientes de la Generalitat”, dijo el Alto tribunal, en una sentencia dictada por unanimidad.\n\nDe esta forma, el Supremo ratifica el fallo del pasado diciembre del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Catalunya, pero la inhabilitación no se hizo efectiva entonces porque Torra recurrió ante el Supremo.\n\nEl caso se deriva de la negativa de Torra a seguir las órdenes de la Junta Electoral Central de eliminar una pancarta colgada en la fachada del Palau de la Generalitat en apoyo a los líderes independentistas encarcelados y autoexiliados durante las elecciones generales españolas de abril de 2019.\n\nTorra se ha defendido a sí mismo alegando motivos de libertad de expresión, pero el Alto Tribunal dijo que su fallo no tenía como objeto analizar los derechos personales, sino el desafío a un organismo constitucional.\n\nLa deriva separatista de Cataluña ha dominado la política española durante varios años, en particular desde que su parlamento regional declarara unilateralmente la independencia en octubre de 2017 tras un referéndum declarado ilegal por la justicia española.\n\n“Suprema vergüenza”, tuiteó Jordi Turull, uno de los líderes catalanes encarcelados tras conocerse el fallo.\n\n“Una vez más, el Estado español interfiere en nuestras instituciones democráticas”, añadió el predecesor de Torra, Carles Puigdemont, exiliado por voluntad propia en Bélgica.\n\nLa sentencia puede apelarse, pero entra en vigor una vez que le sea notificada a Torra, por lo que el vicepresidente catalán y diputado por Esquerra Republicana, Pere Aragonés, debería convertirse pronto en presidente interino de la Generalitat.\n\nLa inhabilitación dará lugar a la celebración de unas elecciones anticipadas en Cataluña si, como se espera, el parlamento regional no inviste un candidato para el puesto en los próximos días.\n\nTorra dijo a principios de este mes que su destitución provocaría unos comicios innecesarios y crearía inestabilidad durante la lucha contra la pandemia de la COVID-19.\n\nCristina Narbona, presidenta del Partido Socialista (PSOE) del presidente del Gobierno central, Pedro Sánchez, dijo que deberían celebrarse rápidamente nuevas elecciones regionales para detener la “parálisis política” en Cataluña.\n\nLos 7,5 millones de catalanes están divididos sobre la independencia de la región, con la última encuesta de opinión mostrando un 42% a favor y un 50% en contra.",

  "text": "FILE PHOTO: Uber's logo is displayed on a mobile phone in London, Britain, September 14, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo\n\nLONDRES , 28 sep (Reuters) - Uber ha conseguido en los tribunales el restablecimiento de su licencia para operar en Londres, que le había sido retirada por el regulador de transporte de la capital británica por motivos de seguridad, después de que un juez decidiera el lunes que era un operador apto y adecuado pesa a los fallos el pasado. Transport for London (TfL), organismo encargado del sistema de transporte público de la capital británica, se negó a conceder a la empresa con sede en Silicon Valley una nueva licencia en 2019 debido a lo que entonces llamó un “patrón de errores”, que incluía miles de viajes realizados en los que conductores distintos a los anunciados recogían pasajeros.\n\nUber argumentó que desde entonces ha subsanado las preocupaciones sobre la verificación de sus seguros y la identificación de sus conductores. TfL ya le había denegado la licencia en 2017, lo que supuso un duro golpe para el grupo estadounidense en uno de sus mercados más importantes, antes de que otro juez la restituyera por un período de prueba. “A pesar de sus deficiencias históricas, considero que ahora es una empresa apta para tener una licencia de operador de VTC (vehículos de turismo con conductor) en Londres”, dijo el juez Tan Ikram en su veredicto por escrito, en el que concedió a la empresa una licencia para operar durante año y medio. Uber, que se disculpó por los errores cometidos, se ha topado con obstáculos reglamentarios y reticencias en otros países, lo que le ha obligado a retirarse de algunos mercados. Las acciones de Uber subían un 6% en las transacciones previas a la apertura del mercado bursátil en EEUU tras la decisión.\n\n“Esta decisión es un reconocimiento al compromiso de Uber con la seguridad. Seguiremos trabajando de forma constructiva con TfL”, dijo Jamie Heywood, jefe de la compañía en Europa del norte y del este.\n\nUber se enfrenta en Londres a rivales como Ola, Freenow y Bolt.\n\nLos taxistas tradicionales de la capital han bloqueado las calles en protesta por lo que consideran una amenaza para sus medios de vida.\n\nPor su parte el alcalde de Londres, Sadiq Khan, que también preside TfL, advirtió el lunes a Uber que debe atenerse a sus obligaciones.\n\n“Puedo asegurar a los londinenses que TfL continuará monitorizando a Uber y no dudará en tomar medidas si no cumple con los estándares requeridos para proteger a los pasajeros”, dijo en un comunicado.",

Moscú tiene una alianza defensiva con Armenia, mientras que Ankara apoya a sus vecinos de etnia turca en Azerbaiyán.\n\n“No hemos visto nada como esto desde el alto el fuego de la guerra en los años 90. Hay combates en todas las secciones de la línea del frente”, dijo Olesya Vartanyan, analista principal para la región del Grupo de Crisis del Cáucaso Sur.\n\nVartanyan dijo que el despliegue de cohetes y artillería trajo consigo un mayor riesgo de víctimas civiles que podría hacer que la escalada fuera difícil de detener por medios diplomáticos.\n\n“Si hay bajas masivas será extremadamente difícil contener esta lucha y definitivamente veremos una guerra en toda regla que tendrá una posible intervención de Turquía o Rusia, o de ambos”, dijo Vartanyan.\n\nLa región del Cáucaso sur es un corredor de oleoductos y gasoductos que transportan hidrocarburos a los mercados mundiales.\n\nEl Alto Karabaj, también conocido como Nagorno Karabaj, se encuentra dentro de Azerbaiyán pero está dirigido por personas de etnia armenia, que son la mayoría en la zona.\n\nFuentes dijeron que los residentes de Stepanakert, la capital de Nagorno Karabaj, se habían ocultado en refugios antiaéreos y se oían bombardeos constantes. Todas las tiendas estaban cerradas y casi nadie estaba en las calles.\n\nEl presidente de Turquía, Tayyip Erdogan, exigió a Armenia que se retire inmediatamente de las tierras azeríes que, según dijo, está ocupando y sostuvo que es hora de poner fin a la crisis de Nagorno Karabaj.\n\nEl presidente de Azerbaiyán declaró la ley marcial de forma parcial y su canciller dijo que seis civiles habían muerto y otros 19 estaban heridos. En tanto, un representante del Ministerio de Defensa de Armenia dijo que 200 armenios habían resultado heridos, según reportó la agencia de noticias Interfax.\n\nLas autoridades del Nagorno Karabaj informaron que otros 28 de sus soldados habían muerto, un día después de que reportara 16 militares fallecidos y más de 100 heridos como consecuencia del ataque armenio. También dijeron que habían recuperado parte del territorio sobre el cual había perdido el control en el primer enfrentamiento del domingo.\n\nEl Ministerio de Defensa de Azerbaiyán dijo que las fuerzas armenias estaban bombardeando la ciudad de Terter.\n\nChina y Rusia instaron a ambas partes a moderar sus posturas.\n\nLos enfrentamientos han desatado un aluvión de respuestas diplomáticas con las que se pretende reducir las tensiones de un conflicto de décadas de antigüedad entre Armenia, de mayoría cristiana, y Azerbaiyán, de mayoría musulmana. Rusia pidió un alto el fuego inmediato, mientras que Turquía dijo que apoyaría a Azerbaiyán, su aliado tradicional en la zona.\n\nEl Alto Karabaj se separó de Azerbaiyán en un conflicto desatado tras el colapso de la Unión Soviética en 1991.",

Cuando se le preguntó si esperaba que el gobierno estadounidense respondiera con medidas económicas o militares, el diplomático respondió: “Ataques”.\n\nEl Departamento de Estado, consultado sobre los planes para retirarse de Irak, dijo: “No comentamos sobre las conversaciones diplomáticas privadas del Secretario con líderes extranjeros (...) Los grupos respaldados por Irán que lanzan cohetes contra nuestra embajada son un peligro no solo para nosotros sino para el Gobierno de Irak “.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON, 28 sep (Reuters) - El presidente Donald Trump y el exvicepresidente Joe Biden se enfrentarán el martes en su primer debate presidencial. A cinco semanas de las elecciones generales del 3 de noviembre, hay mucho en juego.\n\nTrabajadores preparan el escenario para el primer debate presidencial entre el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, y el candidato presidencial demócrata y ex vicepresidente Joe Biden en el campus de la Cleveland Clinic en Cleveland, Ohio, EEUU, 28 de septiembre de 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nA continuación, cinco aspectos a los que habrá que estar atentos durante los 90 minutos del debate que se celebrará en Cleveland (Ohio):\n\nPUNTOS CALIENTES\n\nEl enfrentamiento televisado llega en un momento en el que Trump se enfrenta a preguntas persistentes, basadas en sus declaraciones sobre el amaño de elecciones o sobre si aceptará o no los resultados en caso de que resulte perdedor. Con millones de personas en casa viéndolo, ¿cómo responderá si Biden lo empuja a comprometerse con una transferencia de poderes pacífica?\n\nAmbos candidatos también se pelearán por la nominación de Trump de Amy Coney Barrett a jueza del Tribunal Supremo de los Estados Unidos. Trump está usando su candidatura para reunir a su base de votantes conservadores y distraer a las masas de su gestión del coronavirus y otros asuntos, mientras que Biden está advirtiendo sobre las amenazas para la atención sanitaria y el derecho al aborto.\n\nEL MOMENTO DE BIDEN\n\nPara Biden, el debate servirá como una especie de reintroducción. Aunque ha celebrado eventos limitados en algunos Estados y concedido entrevistas a los medios de comunicación, la pandemia de coronavirus lo ha dejado fuera de escena durante meses.\n\nEsto ha permitido a Biden mantener el foco donde él desea: en Trump y su desempeño en el cargo de presidente. Pero el martes, el candidato demócrata tendrá que labrarse sus propios argumentos para hacerse con la presidencia, mientras da respuestas concisas y evita algunos de los percances verbales que lo han perseguido a lo largo de su carrera política.\n\nCon Biden liderando en las encuestas, un fuerte resultado tras el debate podría poner a Trump contra las cuerdas. Pero uno débil podría reconfigurar la carrera hacia la presidencia.\n\nRESPONSABILIDADES\n\nCuando tiene enfrente asuntos como las alarmantes estadísticas sobre el coronavirus o los disturbios en las calles, Trump se apresura a culpar a los representantes demócratas, activistas y científicos -cualquiera menos él. Uno de los objetivos de Biden será asegurarse de que el público entienda que Trump es el responsable.\n\nTrump podría sacar ventaja de su administración, como a menudo trata de hacer con la economía. A los votantes les gusta ver a un presidente asumir la responsabilidad, para lo bueno y lo malo.\n\nJohn Geer, un experto en la opinión de los votantes de la Universidad de Vanderbilt, se pregunta si Trump reaccionará mal a las preguntas agudas o poco amistosas del moderador Chris Wallace de Fox News. “¿Tendrá Trump dificultades para contestar a preguntas que no sean fáciles de responder?, dijo Geer.\n\nTERGIVERSANDO LA VERDAD\n\nTal y como muestran los mítines de la campaña de Trump, el presidente puede disparar falsedades a modo de ametralladora. Los ejemplos incluyen la afirmación común de los republicanos de que la economía de EEUU estaba operando a niveles históricos antes de la pandemia (no lo estaba) y que el virus se ha disipado en gran medida (no lo ha hecho).\n\nEl intento de señalar constantemente la verdad frente a Trump podría convertir a Biden en un verificador de datos en tiempo real, posiblemente en detrimento del demócrata.\n\n“Es un gran error tratar de hacer eso”, dijo Aaron Kall, el director de debate de la Universidad de Michigan. “Tienes que concentrarte en tu propia agenda.”\n\nMETERSE EN EL BARRO\n\nBiden ha mostrado su preocupación en voz alta por reaccionar a la propensión de los ataques “ad hóminem” de Trump. En la campaña, el exvicepresidente ha mostrado a veces destellos de temperamento, haciendo gala de su origen irlandés, como él lo llama.\n\nEl domingo, Trump llegó a sugerir en un tuit que Biden tomará drogas para mejorar su rendimiento durante el debate, indicando que tal vez hay poco que no hará o dirá para poner nervioso a Biden e interrumpir el encuentro.\n\nLas encuestas muestran que el frecuente cuestionamiento de Trump sobre la salud mental de Biden, de 77 años, ha calado en algunos votantes. El equipo de Trump buscará momentos en los que Biden parezca estar nervioso o inseguro para hacerle explotar como un video viral.\n\n“Si el presidente miente, llámalo mentira. Si ataca a Biden personalmente, simplemente encoge los hombros y no lo tomes como algo personal”, dijo Geer. “Biden necesita seguir siendo presidencial y duro, incluso si le salpica algo de barro en la chaqueta de su traje”.",

  "text": "FRÁNCFORT, 28 sep (Reuters) - Los responsables de política monetaria del Banco Central Europeo (BCE) están cada vez más divididos sobre cómo gestionar la economía del bloque durante una segunda ola de COVID-19, amenazando una paz costosamente ganada por la presidenta de la entidad, Christine Lagarde.\n\nFOTO DE ARCHIVO: La Presidenta del Banco Central Europeo (BCE), Christine Lagarde, durante una conferencia de prensa, en Fráncfort, Alemania, el 12 de marzo de 2020. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nLagarde ha logrado poner fin a las luchas internas que el año pasado sembraron el caos en el seno del BCE durante los últimos meses de mandato de Mario Draghi. La dirigente francesa también ha impulsado varios paquetes de estímulo sin precedentes para mantener la economía del bloque a flote en medio de la pandemia.\n\nSu promesa de buscar el consenso y atraer a los escépticos está en claro contraste con la política llevada a cabo por su predecesor, Draghi, que rara vez contó con sus principales oponentes dentro del organismo y señalaba la dirección de sus medidas incluso antes de debatirlas en el Consejo de Gobierno.\n\nPero las tensiones están aumentando de nuevo. La nueva ola de infecciones obliga al BCE a contemplar la posibilidad de un estímulo fiscal aún mayor. En este escenario, se están reabriendo viejas heridas y el economista jefe del BCE, Philip Lane, recibe críticas desde todos los sectores.\n\nLos responsables de política monetaria conservadores -conocidos en la jerga de los bancos centrales como “halcones”- argumentan que el BCE está minimizando algunas buenas noticias, como los indicadores económicos registrados durante el verano, que fueron mejores de lo esperado.\n\nAl otro lado del tablero, las “palomas” o banqueros centrales inclinados hacia la flexibilización monetaria presionan a Lagarde para que adopte un lenguaje más contundente ante los riesgos para el crecimiento y la amenaza de la apreciación del euro frente al dólar.\n\nLos desacuerdos quedaron de manifiesto durante la última reunión de política monetaria celebrada en septiembre, según indicaron a Reuters ocho fuentes distintas cercanas a las conversaciones.\n\nLos halcones quieren que, dadas las condiciones relativamente benignas del mercado, el BCE reduzca discretamente sus compras de bonos, ahorrando munición para incrementar el ritmo de compras de nuevo si fuera necesario. Todo ello sin aumentar el tamaño del Programa de Compras de Emergencia para Pandemias (PEPP por sus siglas en inglés).\n\nAlgunos sostienen además que las proyecciones económicas son demasiado pesimistas porque no tienen en cuenta las medidas de estímulo fiscal ya anunciadas, que inevitablemente darían lugar a un aumento del crecimiento y la inflación.\n\nAmbos puntos fueron rechazados por Lane, como también lo fue el llamamiento a dar una advertencia más clara sobre los riesgos para el crecimiento de un euro más fuerte, dijeron las fuentes.\n\nEl BCE, que habla en nombre de los miembros del consejo, se negó a hacer comentarios.\n\n¿REBELIÓN DE LAS “PALOMAS”?\n\nAunque la mayoría de responsables defiende en público la postura de Lagarde de “esperar y ver”, algunos adoptaron en la reunión un tono decidido de acomodamiento monetario y debatieron abiertamente las perspectivas de un mayor estímulo, algo que Lagarde ha evitado deliberadamente.\n\nVarias de las fuentes -que hablaron bajo condición de anonimato- se opusieron especialmente a unos comentarios de la semana pasada de Fabio Panetta, miembro del Consejo de Gobierno, que vería con buenos ojos que el BCE pecase más por exceso que por defecto.\n\nPanetta, que se unió al consejo a principios de año, argumentó que el BCE que la inflación seguía incómodamente por debajo del objetivo del BCE y que en tales situaciones podría ser necesaria una respuesta política.\n\n“Es como si Mario hubiera vuelto”, dijo una de las fuentes, refiriéndose a la tendencia de Draghi a desviarse del mensaje del Consejo de Gobierno antes de que otros tuvieran la oportunidad de opinar.\n\nEn cualquier caso, las fuentes agregaron que Lagarde, por ahora, está cumpliendo su parte del trato e incluso está alcanzando compromisos con los políticos con los que Draghi no habló.\n\n“Lagarde está trabajando sin parar y en junio se las arregló para obtener un consenso, así que no tengo ninguna razón para pensar que está a punto de cambiar su estilo”, dijo otra fuente.\n\nAlgunos altos cargos del BCE han abogado por aumentar la cuota de compra de bonos de emergencia a 2 billones de euros desde los actuales 1,35 billones de euros, pero Lagarde rechazó tal sugerencia, reforzando su credibilidad entre los responsables que a menudo estaban en desacuerdo con Draghi, dijo una de las fuentes.\n\nLas fuentes dijeron que si bien es posible que sea necesario adoptar medidas de política monetaria en diciembre, llevar los desacuerdos al dominio público y alimentar las expectativas del mercado con comentarios sobre flexibilización podría hacer más difícil mantener el consenso.",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nLas acciones de Siemens Energy —que fabrica turbinas de gas, sistemas de transmisión de energía y tiene una participación del 67% en el grupo de aerogeneradores Siemens Gamesa— abrieron a 22,01 euros cada una el lunes, dando a la compañía un valor de mercado de 16.000 millones de euros (18.600 millones de dólares).\n\nUna fuente consultada había dicho anteriormente que las estimaciones eran de un valor de mercado de entre 21.000 y 22.000 mil millones de euros.\n\nA las 1051 GMT, las acciones habían bajado un 1,9% respecto a los 21,60 euros de salida al mercado, habiendo cotizado en una horquilla de 19,21-22,98 euros durante el tiempo transcurrido de sesión.\n\n“He señalado repetidamente que esperamos que la volatilidad sea alta en las primeras semanas”, dijo a Reuters el director financiero de Siemens, Ralf Thomas. “No es una situación específica de Siemens Energy, es lo mismo con cada operación de segregación”.\n\nSiemens Energy es la mayor empresa segregada de su matriz en Alemania, superando incluso a Lanxess y Covestro, que fueron escindidas del grupo Bayer.\n\nThomas dijo que hasta mediados de octubre no se podría tener una primera idea de cómo se valorará Siemens Energy, que compite con General Electric y Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\n\nSeparada de Siemens debido a sus débiles márgenes de beneficio, la división segregada prevé un margen de no más del 1% en 2020 sobre los beneficios antes de intereses, impuestos y amortización antes de partidas extraordinarias (EBITDA), debido a la crisis del coronavirus y a la debilidad del negocio de turbinas eólicas en tierra firme.\n\nEste margen debería aumentar a entre el 6,5% y el 8,5% en 2023, gracias a más de 1.300 millones de euros de recortes de gastos que, según una fuente, incluirán el cierre de algunas de las plantas de producción del grupo.\n\nSiemens AG ha cedido inicialmente el 55% de Siemens Energy con la salida a bolsa, pero planea reducir su participación directa restante del 35,1% de manera significativa dentro de los 12-18 meses de la cotización.

  "text": "28 sep (Reuters) - Las empresas estadounidenses con brotes de COVID-19 se enfrentan a una amenaza legal emergente por las demandas de los trabajadores que se llevaron el coronavirus a casa y de sus parientes infectados, una contingencia que según una empresa de análisis de riesgos podría costar a las empresas miles de millones de dólares.\n\nFOTO DE ARCHIVO: Una sanitaria transporta en camilla a un enfermo de COVID-19 en Houston, Texas, EEUU. 19 de agosto de 2020. REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare\n\nLa hija de Esperanza Ugalde de Illinois presentó en agosto una demanda de estas características por homicidio imprudente —la primera de este tipo según abogados consultados—, alegando que su madre murió por COVID-19 después de que su padre contrajese la enfermedad en la planta de procesamiento de carne de Aurora Packing Co.\n\nEstos casos toman prestados elementos del caso del amianto y esquivan los límites a la responsabilidad por accidentes en el lugar de trabajo, lo que expone a las empresas a elevados costes por daños y perjuicios, incluso aunque el demandante no haya puesto un pie en las instalaciones.\n\n“Las empresas deberían preocuparse mucho por estos casos”, dijo el abogado laboral y de empleo Tom Gies de Crowell & Moring, que defiende a los empleadores.\n\nLa demanda contra Aurora alega que Ricardo Ugalde trabajó “hombro con hombro” en la línea de procesamiento de la empresa en abril cuando Aurora sabía que había un brote de coronavirus en sus instalaciones y no advirtió a los empleados ni adoptó ninguna medida de prevención de infecciones.\n\nAurora no respondió a una solicitud de comentarios.\n\nSe cree que entre el 7% y el 9% de las cerca de 200.000 muertes por COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos hasta la fecha se deben a infecciones llevadas del trabajo a casa y las demandas podrían costar a las empresas hasta 21.000 millones de dólares si el número de muertes en Estados Unidos llega a 300.000, según Praedicat, una empresa que evalúa los riesgos para las aseguradoras.\n\nRob Reville, CEO de Praedicat, advierte que este es el peor escenario posible y dijo que los casos podrían tener una factura inferior en función de cómo interpreten las demandas los jueces.\n\nEl sistema de compensación a los trabajadores de EEUU generalmente dificulta que estos presenten demandas por la enfermedad COVID-19. El sistema pone un tope a la responsabilidad de las empresas y prohíbe demandas costosas a cambio de pagos rápidos a los empleados, que no necesitan probar la culpa.\n\nPero Esperanza Ugalde no era una empleada de Aurora, así que su familia puede demandar a la empresa. Dependiendo de las circunstancias, un caso exitoso de homicidio por imprudencia puede superar el millón de dólares en daños.\n\nEste tipo de casos han existido durante década en los contenciosos por el amianto y los tribunales se han dividido a la hora de decidir si una empresa tiene obligación con personas que nunca han pisado sus instalaciones.\n\nEn 2013, un jurado de California concedió a Rose-Marie Griggs 27,3 millones de dólares en daños compensatorios y punitivos después de que contrajera un mesotelioma que, según sus abogados, fue causado por las fibras de amianto que llegaban a su casa en la década de 1950 en la ropa de trabajo de su marido, que instalaba aislamientos para una filial de Owens-Illinios Inc.\n\nLa empresa apeló y las dos partes llegaron a un acuerdo extrajudicial antes del fallo de apelación.",

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nEn términos generales, los analistas creen que el plan de Biden de aumentar los impuestos corporativos podría añadir presión a los beneficios de las empresas. Pero también esperan que apoye proyectos de infraestructuras y energías renovables.\n\nUn nuevo mandato de Trump, por su parte, podría traer más recortes de impuestos y extender la desregulación, lo que podría beneficiar a los sectores energético y financiero, a costa de aumentar los riesgos derivados de las tensiones con China.\n\nEn unas elecciones en las que también está en juego la mayoría del Senado, un partido podría controlar la presidencia y el Congreso, lo que facilitaría la promulgación de leyes, por ejemplo el nuevo paquete de ayudas contra la pandemia de coronavirus que actualmente se encuentra en un punto muerto.\n\nA continuación, echamos un vistazo a las acciones que podrían encajar mejor en una cartera de Biden o Trump:\n\nOPCIONES BIDEN\n\nENERGÍA ALTERNATIVA: El mayor impulso a las “energías verdes” que se espera bajo una Administración de Biden podría ayudar a las acciones del sector renovable. Por ejemplo, las extensiones de créditos fiscales proporcionarían un impulso a as acciones de energía solar como Sunnova Energy International, SunPower Corp y Enphase Energy, según Credit Suisse.\n\nVEHÍCULOS ELÉCTRICOS: Las acciones de Tesla ya han tenido una trayectoria impresionante durante la administración de Trump, pero algunos creen que una presidencia de Biden podría empujar aún más a las acciones de la compañía de vehículos eléctricos.\n\n“Biden ha propuesto nuevos incentivos fiscales, compras estatales y otras medidas para beneficiar a los vehículos eléctricos en particular”, dijo en un informe Garrett Nelson, analista de CFRA.\n\nOtros posibles ganadores de una victoria de Biden serían los proveedores de automóviles centrados en la electrificación y las tecnologías verdes y libres de emisiones, como Aptiv, BorgWarner y Visteon, según Nelson.\n\nINFRAESTRUCTURAS: Un gran paquete de gastos de infraestructuras “puede ser una prioridad inicial para una Administración Biden en su intento de lograr apoyos de los dos partidos”, según Ryan Detrick, estratega jefe de mercados de LPL Financial.\n\nEl plan de Biden impulsaría a un amplio grupo de empresas de ingeniería y construcción, con AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group y MasTec entre los mayores beneficiarios, según Andrew Kaplowitz, analista de Citi.\n\nCOMERCIO EXTERIOR: La Administración Biden podría traer un apaciguamiento de la guerra de aranceles entre EEUU y China. “Si la política comercial se centrara menos en el uso de los aranceles, tanto los importadores como los exportadores podrían beneficiarse”, según David Joy, estratega jefe de mercado de Ameriprise Financial.\n\nEn un informe de julio, JP Morgan incluyó a Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher y 3M entre una serie de acciones que podrían tener un mejor rendimiento si la presidencia de Biden condujera a una “desescalada” de las tensiones arancelarias entre EEUU y China.\n\nOPCIONES TRUMP\n\nAYUDAS TRIBUTARIAS: Una derrota de Biden podría significar un alivio adicional para las empresas que se beneficiaron de los recortes de impuestos corporativos del actual presidente.\n\nEn su informe de julio, JP Morgan enumeró a AT&T, Target y Waste Management entre las compañías que se beneficiaron de las leyes sobre empleo e impuestos de Trump, y que por lo tanto podrían tener un rendimiento inferior en una presidencia de Biden.\n\nBANCOS: Además de un impuesto de sociedades más alto, los bancos podrían enfrentarse al problema de una regulación más estricta bajo una Administración Biden, particularmente si el exvicepresidente da un papel relevante a una progresista como la senadora Elizabeth Warren.\n\nLos analistas de Keefe, Bruyette & Woods dicen que una victoria de Trump en la que los republicanos retengan el Senado es el mejor escenario electoral para los bancos, señalando que “la agenda republicana de reducción de la regulación permanecería intacta”. Las acciones que interesan en ese escenario son, entre otras, Wells Fargo y Citigroup, según KBW.\n\nDEFENSA: Trump probablemente “lograría mantener un gran gasto en defensa, a pesar de una Cámara Demócrata, dada la realidad de la lucha de grandes potencias con China y Rusia”, dijeron los estrategas de BCA Research en un informe reciente.\n\nCOMPAÑÍAS DE COMBUSTIBLES FÓSILES: “El apoyo a las compañías de energía y específicamente a las de combustibles fósiles parece ser un objetivo recurrente para Trump”, según Detrick, el analista de LPL. Detrick añade que la mayoría de las empresas de este sector, excluyendo las de energía renovable, probablemente se beneficiarán de una victoria de Trump.",

REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nMADRID, 28 sep (Reuters) - La posible salida de Lionel Messi del Barcelona ocupó este verano todas las portada, pero el lunes por la mañana los titulares fueron para otro futbolista: Ansu Fati.\n\nA pesar de tener sólo 17 años, se espera mucho del joven delantero. Y de momento no defrauda. Fati brilló con dos goles y un penalti provocado en la goleada del Barça sobre el Villarreal del domingo. Todo lo hizo en los primeros 35 minutos del partido.\n\nMuchas voces del mundo del fútbol se preguntan cómo será la vida en el Camp Nou cuando Messi se marche. Con el argentino viviendo posiblemente su último año como blaugrana, Fati quizá haya empezado a responder a esa pregunta.\n\nAlineado en la banda izquierda del trío de delanteros, el internacional con España fue un quebradero de cabeza para los rivales. Marcó dos goles en los primeros 20 minutos y, poco después, forzó un penalti que Messi anotó.\n\nSu compañero de equipo Sergio Busquets lo elogió tras el partido: “Tenemos que estar tranquilos con él, sabemos de sus condiciones y su edad. Tiene unas condiciones tremendas, pero no corramos demasiado. Tiene al lado grandes compañeros de los que puede aprender mucho. Hay que dejarle que haga su fútbol y vaya aprendiendo”.\n\nLo que quizá resulte más esperanzador para los hinchas del Barcelona es que la dependencia del equipo en Messi -la famosa “Messidependencia”- parece ser mucho menor con el nuevo entrenador, Ronald Koeman, que en otros años.\n\nMessi apenas fue clave en los primeros 20 minutos, en los que sólo tocó el balón seis veces.\n\nEn ese tramo del partido, todo el peso del ataque cayó en Fati. Su ritmo eléctrico, sus pies rápidos y su juego directo causaron un sinfín de problemas a la defensa visitante. Y mostraron, quizá, que hay vida después de Leo.",

Era solo un bebé cuando Messi debutó con el Barça en 2004. El domingo, tras ser el mejor del encuentro, confesó que creció viendo jugar a Leo y soñando con compartir equipo con él.

Entre otras cosas, Fati se convirtió en el jugador más joven en la historia del Barça en anotar en un partido de Liga. De momento no se le adivina techo, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que tras la marcha de Suárez contará con muchos más minutos de juego.\n\n“Quiero seguir mejorando cada día, seguir aprendiendo de mis compañeros porque son los mejores y tratan de ayudarme a diario”, añadió.\n\nEl entrenador del Barça, Ronald Koeman, reveló el domingo que había recriminado a Fati su actuación en el último partido de pretemporada, contra el Elche, pero alabó sus movimientos y su precisión en el remate contra el Villarreal.\n\n“Le critiqué en su partido contra el Elche pero hoy le he dicho que ha hecho un gran encuentro. Ha sido muy directo y hemos aprovechado su calidad”, agregó el neerlandés.\n\n“Es un jugador joven que tiene que buscar el rendimiento constante. Hoy demostró que tiene un gran futuro por delante. Estoy muy contento por su partido”, sentenció el técnico.",

Saúl Ñíguez falló un penal más tarde en la primera mitad, pero el equipo local confirmó su superioridad con goles de Ángel Correa y Joao Félix al comienzo de la segunda parte.\n\nJorge Molina anotó el gol de consuelo del cuadro andaluz en el 86, antes de que Suárez volviera a restaurar la ventaja de cinco goles del “Atleti”.\n\nKoeman, en tanto, tuvo un debut perfecto con el Barcelona en La Liga, en un partido en que el delantero de 17 años Ansu Fati demostró una vez todo su potencial.\n\nFati, que a inicios de mes se convirtió en el jugador más joven en marcar un gol con la camiseta de la selección española en la victoria por 4-0 ante Ucrania por la Liga de Naciones de la UEFA, aprovechó un centro atrás de Jordi Alba para abrir el marcador en el minuto 15 con un remate potente con borde interno.\n\nCuatro minutos después, Fati aumentó su registro goleador con otra gran definición tras pase del brasileño Philippe Coutinho, que regresó al club azulgrana tras estar cedido en el Bayern de Múnich.\n\nEn su segunda temporada en el primer equipo del Barça después de una impresionante campaña de debut, Fati nuevamente fue protagonista al fabricarse un penalti que fue anotado por el capitán Messi al minuto 35.\n\nLa goleada del Barcelona se selló con un gol en propia portería del defensor del Villarreal Pau Torres al final de la primera parte, en un mazazo para el equipo dirigido por Unai Emery, que había sumado un triunfo y un empate en sus dos primeros partidos.\n\nKoeman, que reemplazó a Quique Setién en agosto tras la aplastante derrota 8-2 que le propinó el Bayern en la Liga de Campeones, difícilmente podría haber esperado un mejor debut oficial después del caótico final de temporada marcado por el intento de Messi de dejar el club.\n\n“Ha sido un buen partido para nosotros. En la segunda parte bajamos la intensidad, pero en general las sensaciones son buenas”, dijo el centrocampista azulgrana Sergio Busquets.",

REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nLa última vez que se enfrentaron en la cancha Philippe Chatrier, en la semifinal de 2017, el suizo salió victorioso de un largo encuentro a cinco sets, pero esta vez las cosas fueron mucho más sencillas ante un Murray muy opaco.\n\nCuando los primeros tres juegos disputados en un estadio casi vacío se prolongaron por alrededor de 20 minutos, todo parecía apuntar a otra dura batalla entre dos jugadores que poseen tres títulos de Grand Slam cada uno.\n\nPero cuando Wawrinka -cabeza de serie número 16 y campeón en París en 2015- comenzó a mejorar su juego, se adueñó de un partido en el que, además, brilló por su ausencia el característico espíritu de lucha de Murray, que vistió ‘leggings’ negros en un frío día en la capital francesa.\n\nEl helvético de 35 años registró 42 tiros ganadores contra 10 de Murray para lograr la victoria en una hora y 37 minutos.\n\n“Necesito pensar mucho sobre esto (...) Necesito entender por qué tuve una actuación así”, dijo un frustrado Murray a la prensa. “Eso no fue suficientemente bueno contra nadie, en realidad, especialmente contra alguien tan bueno como Stan”.\n\nOtro de los grandes nombres del torneo, el finalista del Abierto de Estados Unidos Alexander Zverev, se sobrepuso a un comienzo flojo y acabó imponiéndose por 7-5, 6-2 y 6-4 al austriaco Dennis Novak.\n\nEl alemán, que no había jugado sobre tierra batida desde el año pasado, perdía 4-1 en el primer set, pero cambió de actitud a tiempo para ganar en tres sets en la pista Philippe Chatrier, cuyo techo permaneció abierto pese a la llovizna que caía.\n\nTambién se metió en segunda ronda el japonés Kei Nishikori, quien derrotó al británico Dan Evans por 1-6, 6-1, 7-6, 1-6 y 6-4. Este fue apenas el quinto partido de la temporada para el nipón, que se sometió a una cirugía de codo que lo marginó del circuito a principios de año y se perdió el Abierto de Estados Unidos por dar positivo por COVID-19.\n\nEn la jornada también avanzaron tres jugadores argentinos: Diego Schwartzman ganó al serbio Miomir Kecmanovic por 6-0, 6-1 y 6-3; Federico Coria se impuso al taiwanés Jason Jung por 7-5, 7-6 (6) y 7-6 (3); mientras que en un duelo entre compatriotas que se prolongó por casi cinco horas, Juan Ignacio Lóndero batió a Federico Delbonis por 6-4, 7-6 (1), 2-6, 1-6 y 14-12.",

  "text": "SANTIAGO, 25 sep (Reuters) - Las oscuras noches del chileno desierto de Atacama, el más árido del mundo, atraen desde fanáticos de la astronomía hasta grandes centros multinacionales, pero las brillantes luces de ciudades que crecen, autopistas y minas se han convertido en una sigilosa amenaza.\n\nPor eso, los reguladores del medio ambiente empiezan a contraatacar con herramientas legales y un impulso del gobierno para hacer que las regiones protejan las reservas del cielo nocturno.\n\nLas habituales luces led blancas o frías están prohibidas en las zonas en torno a los observatorios astronómicos del norte del país, que alberga actualmente cerca de la mitad de la infraestructura de observación astronómica del mundo.\n\nLa Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente (SMA), que desde su origen hace unos años estuvo enfocada en los incumplimientos sobre otros recursos como agua y aire, prepara para próximas semanas sanciones contra entidades públicas y privadas.\n\n“Esperamos formular cargos a otras empresas que también teníamos detectadas infracciones hace bastante tiempo, pero como hemos mejorado nuestros procesos internos hemos podido acelerar la parte sancionatoria que finalmente en estos casos se requiere para dar una señal disuasiva”, dijo a Reuters el superintendente Cristóbal de la Maza.\n\nYa en agosto formuló cargos contra unidades de las minoristas Falabella y Cencosud, así como contra el edificio corporativo de Escondida, la mina de cobre más grande del mundo.\n\nDe la Maza afirma que esas empresas exceden los límites de emisión de luz. Está pendiente una decisión en esos casos.\n\nBHP, que controla Escondida, y Falabella, matriz de Tottus, dijeron que presentaron un plan correctivo. Cencosud no respondió a una solicitud de comentarios.\n\nAl menos en el papel, en un ajuste a la normativa ambiental, el año pasado se incluyó la definición de zonas de “valor científico y de investigación para la observación astronómica” con el objeto de aplicar mayores restricciones.\n\nUna comisión conformada por seis expertos, convocada por el Ministerio de Ciencia, entregará a finales del año un “listado de zonas geográficas sugeridas y los criterios para su protección”, confirmó a Reuters la instancia gubernamental.\n\n“LABORATORIO NATURAL ÚNICO”\n\nAntofagasta y otras ciudades del vasto desierto de Atacama, han aumentado su tamaño en los últimos años para servir a la industria del cobre y el litio. El desarrollo ha generado nuevas carreteras, centros comerciales y campos deportivos, todos trayendo nuevas fuentes de luz.\n\nGuillermo Blanc, quien encabeza la fundación Cielos de Chile creada por observatorios para abordar el problema, considera que el cielo del desierto es un “laboratorio natural único” que necesita protección por su valor científico.\n\n“La contaminación lumínica, cuando empieza a aumentar, se transforma en una bola de nieve”, dijo en una entrevista con Reuters.\n\nAdemás del auge del turismo astronómico, la calidad de los cielos atrajo también millonarias inversiones de observatorios como el ALMA, que ayudó recientemente a descubrir un probable indicio de vida en Venus, y se construyen otros como el telescopio extremadamente largo (ELT) de ESO, que agrupa a 16 países.\n\n“Hay que proteger esas inversiones y todos esos recursos que están poniendo estos distintos consorcios y darle certeza jurídica y que van a poder operar tranquilamente y cumplir sus función”, señaló el superintendente De la Maza.\n\nEn tanto, Blanc señaló que aunque los cielos mantienen una calidad actual como en pocas partes del mundo, en algunas zonas la luminiscencia en el cielo -que afecta la oscuridad requerida para la investigación- ha aumentado hasta un 10%.\n\nExpertos comparan el riesgo con el sur de California, en Estados Unidos, donde el crecimiento urbano destruyó el atractivo astronómico que tuvo la región a inicios del siglo XX.\n\nAunque los expertos señalan que un correcto tipo y disposición de la iluminación reduce de gran manera los riesgos de contaminación, tanto científicos como reguladores admiten que el ritmo de expansión en los territorios es una variable menos controlable.\n\n“Si los cielos no están protegidos, podría ser una gran catástrofe”, lamentó Alain Maury, quien ha trabajado 17 años en observación de los cielos en la turística localidad de San Pedro de Atacama.\n\n“En Chile hay leyes para hacerlo pero nadie puede hacerlas cumplir por lo que sigue empeorando”, agregó este amante de la observación, quien ha visto desvanecerse en el cielo algunas estrellas y galaxias que antes podían observarse casi a simple vista.",

The daily death toll was 1,039, bringing the total number of victims to 95,542, the ministry said.\n\nWhile daily cases are down slightly from a peak hit earlier this month, the federal government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indians to remain on guard, with the country’s often-fragile healthcare system struggling to handle the rising number of cases.\n\n“We are far from having achieved any kind of herd immunity, which necessitates that all of us should continue following COVID-appropriate behaviour,” India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told his social media followers in a broadcast on Sunday.",

  "text": "NEW DELHI/ BANGALORE (Reuters) - Indian refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp BPCL.NS will continue to import gasoline for the next few months as its crude processing is hit due to lower demand for diesel that accounts for 40%-45% of its product slate, its head of marketing A. K. Singh said.\n\nA man paints the logo of oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) on a wall on the outskirts of Kochi, India, November 21, 2019. REUTERS/Sivaram V/Files\n\nBPCL is operating refineries at an average of 80% capacity, Singh told a press conference after a shareholders meeting. By design BPCL refineries make 2.5 tonnes of diesel for every 1 tonne of gasoline produced, he said.\n\n“If diesel demand picks up we will not be required to import gasoline as then we will be processing more crude ... diesel is restraining crude throughput ... MS (motor spirit) is almost at pre-pandemic level. Diesel is lagging,” he said.\n\nAsia’s gasoline refining margin surged to a 6-1/2 month high on Monday as supplies tightened, industry sources said. India’s recent spot demand also provided support to the Asian gasoline market.\n\nIndia’s gasoline demand in September recovered to last year’s level as passenger cars sales surged last month and motorists are relying on personal vehicles for commuting amid rising cases of coronavirus.\n\nSlowing industrial activity has delayed a recovery in diesel consumption, largely used by commercial vehicles. Diesel demand this month is 8%-9% lower than year-ago levels, he said.\n\nSingh hoped India’s diesel sales would recover next month during the festival season.\n\nBPCL will completely stop importing gasoline from April next year when it would start new units at its Kochi refinery to upgrade naphtha into gasoline, he added.\n\nHe hoped BPCL will go back to its pre-COVID product slate in next two-three months, notwithstanding lower demand of jet fuel which is just 4%-5% of its overall output, he said.\n\nBPCL, which the federal government has targeted to privatise in this fiscal year to March, is in talks to buy Oman Oil Co's stake in its joint-venture Bharat Oman Refinery Ltd BHAM.BO, which operates a refinery in central India, its head of finance said.\n\n“There has been an interest expressed by Oman side to divest its stake in BORL.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nAll 66 respondents in a Reuters poll expect the repo rate to remain unchanged at 4.0% and a large majority see no cuts until the January-March quarter. The RBI will then likely stay on hold until the end of 2021.\n\nThe MPC which was scheduled to meet between Sept. 29 to Oct. 1 but will now meet at a later date which is yet to be announced, RBI said on Monday.\n\nThe central bank must manage high retail inflation while keeping policy accommodative to support an economy which nosedived 23.9% last quarter, the weakest performance on record.\n\nIt has so far slashed rates by 115 basis points in response to the COVID-19 pandemic since late March.\n\n“India’s inflation-constrained central bank is unlikely to deliver a rate cut, and we expect all policy rates to stay unchanged,” said Rahul Bajoria, economist with Barclays adding that the RBI will however provide economic projections.\n\nIndia is gradually reopening its economy from a lockdown but economic activity remains depressed as coronavirus cases top six million, the second-highest globally.\n\nThe South Asian country was already facing a cyclical downturn before the pandemic struck and is now expected to mark its first full-year contraction since 1979 this year as millions are left unemployed in the world’s second-most populous country.\n\nThe RBI has so far refrained from providing any forecasts on growth or inflation due to the heightened uncertainty and risk of projections having to be revised frequently.\n\nHowever, the central bank is required by law to provide economic forecasts once every six months.\n\n“Data projections from the central bank will be critical, as it would lay out the RBI’s assessment of the extent of the current slowdown and the medium-term implications of the current crisis,” Bajoria said.\n\nThe RBI has maintained that it sees the current rise in inflation as transitional and expects to see prices come down, giving it room to reduce rates to support growth.\n\nAugust inflation, at 6.69%, held above the top end of the RBI’s medium-term target range of 2-6% for the fifth consecutive month amid supply disruptions.",

  "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three of Apple Inc's AAPL.O top contract manufacturers plan to invest a total of almost $900 million in India in the next five years to tap into a new production-linked incentive plan, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nFoxconn 2317.TW, Wistron 3231.TW and Pegatron 4938.TW all plan to make investments under the scheme, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.\n\nIndia’s new $6.65 billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme offers companies cash incentives on any increase in sales of locally-made smartphones over the next five years, compared with 2019-20 levels. The scheme aims to help transform India into an export manufacturing hub.\n\nFoxconn has applied to invest about 40 billion rupees ($542 million), while Wistron and Pegatron have committed to invest close to 13 billion rupees and 12 billion rupees, respectively, under the PLI plan, the sources said.\n\nIt is unclear whether all of the investment will be targeted at boosting manufacturing of Apple devices in India, but the sources and industry insiders said the vast majority would be focused on expanding iPhone manufacturing in the country.\n\nFoxconn said that as a matter of policy it did not comment on specific operations or work for any customer. Apple, Wistron, Pegatron and India’s technology ministry, which formulated the PLI scheme, did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nWhile Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron make devices for companies other than Apple globally, Wistron’s arm in India currently assembles only iPhones.\n\nWistron, which assembles roughly 200,000 second-generation iPhone SEs per month in India, plans to scale that up to 400,000 a month by the end of the year, one of the sources said, as it looks to cater to export demand for the device.\n\nThat plan is expected to create roughly 10,000 jobs, the source added.\n\nPegatron is yet to start Indian operations, but has been in talks with several states, with Tamil Nadu in the south emerging as a frontrunner for a planned plant to manufacture Apple devices, a third source said.\n\nFoxconn, which also assembles devices for Xiaomi 1810.HK in India, already has enough capacity to meet Xiaomi's needs and is likely to use the PLI plan largely to boost iPhone production, a fourth source said.\n\nThe commitments would help Apple diversify its supply chain beyond China, which is locked in a trade war with the United States.\n\nApple started assembling in 2017 a low-cost iPhone model in India through Wistron’s local unit in the tech hub of Bengaluru. It later ramped up production, with Foxconn beginning to assemble iPhones last year and Wistron widening operations.\n\n“India is key to Apple’s global ambitions as it expands beyond China,” said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. “It offers a strategic market to them where skilled labour is cheaper as compared to other manufacturing destinations, the size of the internal market is huge and the export potential is enormous.”\n\nLocal manufacturing helps Apple save costly duties levied on imports of fully-built phones and components in India, where the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant accounts for just 1% of smartphone shipments.\n\nApple is looking to change that. It launched its online store in India last week, and is building its first company-run retail store in the financial hub of Mumbai.",

And those clauses will remain in that bill.”\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said in London that Britain’s focus was on progress in trade talks.\n\n“Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,” he said.\n\n“We simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.”\n\nTrade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy links and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far.\n\nEU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more talks before their next summit on Oct. 15-16. They will then assess whether to try push a deal over the line or prepare for the most damaging Brexit at the end of the year.\n\nThe EU says negotiators must seal an agreement by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments in the EU so that it can take effect from 2021 when Britain’s standstill transition ends after Brexit.\n\nOtherwise, the delicate peace on the island of Ireland as well as an estimated trillion euros worth of annual EU-UK trade would be at risk as the sides would fall back on general World Trade Organization rules that include tariffs and quotas.",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

  "text": "(Reuters) - Caesars CZR.O is in advanced takeover talks with William Hill WMH.L that value the British bookmaker at 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) and would give the casino operator full control of a quickly expanding U.S. sports-betting and online business.\n\nCaesars was considering offering 272 pence per share and William Hill’s board was inclined to recommend such an offer to shareholders, the companies said on Monday.\n\nWilliam Hill shares on Friday surged to more than 312 pence each after it said it had received separate offers from Caesars and buyout group Apollo APO.N.\n\nThose gains were handed back on Monday, however, leaving the stock at 273 pence, suggesting that even if Apollo counters, investors now expect the price to be far lower.\n\nCaesars only holds 20% of its U.S. joint venture with William Hill but the business is built on a presence in Caesars casinos and its brand name, which the casino owner said it would have the right to terminate in the event of an Apollo buyout.\n\nThe bid significantly undervalues the company but there seems limited scope for bid competition due to the joint venture terms and also since William Hill’s board said it would be minded to recommend the offer, Jefferies analysts said.\n\nApollo did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment outside usual business hours.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nStifel analyst Bridie Barrett said the brokerage’s valuation range for William Hill is 270 pence to around 400 pence.\n\n“While a termination of the relationship with William Hill under new ownership makes little business sense, it does add risk for a private equity acquisition...a price at the upper end of our range is unlikely,” Barrett said.\n\nWilliam Hill’s shares were already trading close to two-year highs before news of the proposals, having fallen to their lowest in 20 years in March.\n\nIt has offset regulatory pressure at home by expanding in the U.S. and partnering with CBS Sports and ESPN to cash in on the relaxation of sports betting rules there.\n\nTo fund the deal, Caesars said it was raising equity and would take out $2 billion of new debt secured against William Hill’s non-U.S. businesses.\n\nCaesars said the enlarged sports and online gaming business in the U.S. could generate between $600-$700 million in net revenue in FY2021.\n\nThe offer comes soon after Eldorado Resorts completed buying bigger rival Caesars for about $8.5 billion, creating a new competitor for larger sector players like Las Vegas Sands LVS.N and Wynn Resorts WYNN.O.",

Pupils under six “could be frightened by his appearance”, the spokesman said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. “I’m a primary school teacher ... I love my job.”\n\nHe said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an “existential crisis”. Since then, he said, “Getting tattoos is my passion.”\n\nHe said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. “Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,” he said.",

  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Big Hit Entertainment, the management label of hugely popular South Korean K-Pop group BTS, priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its range on Monday, as hopeful buyers chased South Korea’s largest listing in three years.\n\nInstitutional investors expressed interest in more than 1,000 times the number of shares on offer, with Big Hit riding on the success of the seven-member band, which has become the first South Korean group to reach No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with song “Dynamite”.\n\nAn army of retail investors, known in South Korea as Ants, is also clamouring to buy stock, while die-hard BTS fans are bidding in hopes of securing even one share in what analysts expect to the country’ hottest listing this year.\n\nBig Hit priced the IPO at 135,000 won ($115) per share, it said in a regulatory filing, the top of an indicative price range of 105,000-135,000 won announced earlier this month.\n\nSome 1,420 institutional investors sought shares in pre-subscription offers, looking for 1,117 times the number available, the filing said. About 98% said they would pay the top-range price or more.\n\n“Big Hit is classified as a kind of global export firm,” said Park Sung-ho, analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.\n\n“Not only has it proven its ability to use Youtube, social media for smart market infiltration, it has fandom platform Weverse which gives unprecedented clarity and control over its revenue sources for a label, and may grow into a true platform player as outside artists increasingly join.”\n\nBig Hit reported a 49.7 billion won ($42.4 million) profit for the first half of 2020 as its online concert and merchandise sales on the Weverse app more than offset event cancellations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe IPO will make the seven BTS members multimillionaire stockholders, as Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk in August gave them 68,385 shares each, worth nearly $7.9 million at the issue price.\n\nThe firm will raise 962.6 billion won ($820 million) through the offer of 7.13 million new shares, the biggest South Korean IPO since Celltrion Healthcare raised 1 trillion won in 2017.\n\nThe pricing values Big Hit at about 4.8 trillion won, taking into account common shares plus redeemable preferred shares that will be converted into common shares upon the IPO.\n\nWith plenty of liquidity in the market, some analysts predict gross bids from retail investors could hit 100 trillion won ($85 billion).\n\nThe central bank is watching the offer closely as a massive oversubscription for shares could send ripples through short-term money markets.\n\nInstitutional and retail investors’ subscriptions are due on Oct. 5-6 and Big Hit is expected to list on the KOSPI on Oct. 15.\n\n($1 = 1,173.0400 won)",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

  "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Uber UBER.N has won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence which was taken away over safety concerns, after a judge ruled on Monday that the company was a fit and proper operator despite \"historical failings\". Transport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a \"pattern of failures\", including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.\n\nUber argued it has since assuaged concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.\n\nThe U.S. company was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017, in a major blow in one of its most important markets, before it was restored on a probationary basis.\n\n“I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,” Judge Tan Ikram said on Monday.\n\n“Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London... operator’s licence,” he said, granting an 18-month right to take rides.\n\nUber, which has apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into backlashes and regulatory challenges elsewhere, including in its home state of California.\n\nShares in Uber rose 6% in pre-market U.S. trading after the decision.\n\n“This decision is a recognition of Uber’s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s boss for Northern and Eastern Europe, said.\n\nIn London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt.\n\nThe city’s traditional black cab drivers have blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also chairs TfL, warned Uber on Monday to stick to its obligations.\n\n“I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers,” he said in a statement.",

  "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium August 21, 2020. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nThe proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.\n\nWarsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.\n\nIn the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.\n\n“The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,” reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nBut the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders’ summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber.\n\nLiberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber’s work on the matter, said Berlin was “cuddling” with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest.\n\n“Without an automatic sanction system, Germany’s proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,” he told Reuters when asked about the scheme.\n\nAccording to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU’s executive European Commission.\n\nThis could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary.\n\nBut those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law.\n\nThat formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.\n\n“FINGER-WAGGING”\n\nSome have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.\n\n“It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn’t find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,” said one official working on the matter.\n\nGermany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc’s next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021.\n\nAsked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.\n\n“There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn’t like our government,” he told reporters.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.8568 euros)",

  "text": "(Reuters) - Seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander came under fire from Nick Kyrgios on Monday after the Swede suggested Andy Murray should consider whether he has the right to accept wild cards into majors at the expense of emerging young players.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nSwede Wilander’s comments came after three-time Grand Slam champion Murray’s first-round defeat by Stan Wawrinka at the French Open on Sunday in which he won only six games.\n\nIt was former world number one Murray’s joint-worst loss at a Grand Slam and came on his return to the French Open after a three-year absence, during which he has had two hip surgeries.\n\n“I keep getting a little disappointed, is it his right to be out there doing that? I did it and I shouldn’t have, it was the biggest mistake I did in my career,” Wilander told Eurosport.\n\n“I think Murray needs to stop thinking of himself and start thinking about who he was. Does he have a right to be out there taking wild cards from the young players?”\n\nAustralian Kyrgios, who has skipped the French Open because of the coronavirus pandemic, quickly jumped to the defence of the 33-year-old British player on Twitter.\n\n“Just read what Wilander said about @andy_murray... shut up Mats, no one cares. Muzz, just know that however long you stay, we all appreciate and enjoy your tennis and banter.\n\n“Also I’ve never watched a point of Mats Wilander.”\n\nMurray returned to singles action last year and won the title in Antwerp where he beat Wawrinka, a result that raised hopes he could again challenge at the top.\n\nHowever, the three-time Grand Slam winner looked a pale shadow of himself on Sunday and admitted after the match that he would have a good hard think about his game.\n\n“It’s tough to quit, for sure. By giving us all hope by playing, it’s just not right,” Wilander said. “I love the fact that he is back and trying.\n\n“Hopefully he’ll figure out why he’s doing it.”\n\nWilander’s Eurosport colleague Alex Corretja, a former coach of Murray, said he respected Wilander’s opinion but said Murray needs to be given a chance to enjoy the rest of his career.\n\n“My advice is to retire one year too late rather than one year too early,” Spaniard Corretja said. “I believe that once the indoors season starts he will feel much better.”",

  "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are increasingly divided over how to steer the economy through a second wave of COVID-19, threatening President Christine Lagarde’s hard-won peace, conversations with eight ECB insiders show.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde gestures as she addresses a news conference on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, in Frankfurt, Germany, March 12, 2020. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nLagarde has managed to end the public infighting that left the ECB in disarray in the final months of Mario Draghi’s tenure last year and she has seamlessly pushed through several record stimulus packages to keep the economy afloat amid the pandemic.\n\nHer pledge to seek consensus and bring sceptics onboard is in stark contrast to her predecessor Draghi, who rarely engaged key opponents of his policies and signalled moves even before any discussion within the Governing Council.\n\nBut tensions are rising again as a fresh surge in infections forces the ECB to contemplate even more stimulus, with old rifts resurfacing and chief economist Philip Lane coming under fire from all sides.\n\nConservative policymakers, known in central bank jargon as “hawks”, argue that the ECB is downplaying some of the good news, such as a stream of better-than-expected economic indicators over the summer.\n\nIn the opposite corner, “dovish” central bankers are pushing Lagarde to adapt stronger language both on the risks to growth and the threat from the euro’s appreciation against the dollar.\n\nDisagreements were already clear during the last policy meeting in September, the eight sources, all with direct knowledge of the process, told Reuters.\n\nThe hawks wanted the ECB to quietly reduce its bond purchases given the relatively benign market conditions, saving its firepower so it can raise the pace of buying again if needed at a later date without increasing the overall size of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).\n\nSome also argued that economic projections were too pessimistic because they failed to account for fiscal stimulus measures already announced which would inevitably lead to higher growth and inflation.\n\nBoth of these points were rejected by chief economist Lane, but so was a call to give a clearer warning about the risks to growth from a stronger euro, the sources said.\n\nThe ECB, which speaks on behalf of board members, declined to comment.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nDOVISH REBELLION?\n\nWhile most policymakers have echoed Lagarde’s “wait and see” stance in public statements, some took a decisively dovish tone in the meeting, openly discussing prospects for more stimulus, something Lagarde has deliberately steered clear of.\n\nSome of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, especially objected to ECB board member Fabio Panetta’s comments last week that the ECB should err on the side of doing too much rather than too little.\n\nPanetta, who joined the board at the start of the year, argued that inflation was uncomfortably below the ECB’s target and in such situations a policy response may be necessary.\n\n“It’s like Mario is back,” one of the sources said, referring to Draghi’s tendency to deviate from the Governing Council’s message and front-run policy before others had a chance to weigh in.\n\nBut the sources added that Lagarde is for now keeping her end of the bargain and she is even engaging with policymakers Draghi did not talk to.\n\n“She’s working the phones non-stop and managed to get a consensus in June so I have no reason to think she’s about to change her style,” another source said.\n\nSome senior ECB staff have advocated increasing the quota for emergency bond buying to 2 trillion euros from the current 1.35 trillion euros but Lagarde pushed back on that suggestion, bolstering her credibility among policymakers who were often at odds with Draghi, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources said that while policy action may be necessary in December, bringing disagreements into the public domain and fuelling market expectations with dovish comments could make it more difficult to keep it consensual.\n\n“If you front-run policy in public debate, then you harden positions and make it difficult to compromise,” one of the sources said. “That’s when you get public dissent and market confusion.”\n\nThe sources also agreed that while the possibility of a rate cut was still there, as often stated by the bank, there was no appetite for such a move and it was not being discussed.\n\nLANE ON THE SPOT\n\nWhile the majority of policymakers were happy with Lagarde’s management style, Lane, who is seen as the most influential voice on policy matters, was criticised by both factions.\n\nOn the one hand, he was criticised for a choice of words deemed too timid on the euro’s appreciation at the Sept. 10 policy meeting, underwhelming traders.\n\nSome policymakers had insisted during the policy meeting on tougher language, like that used by Draghi in 2018, but Lane pushed back, two sources said.\n\nOn the other hand, hawks objected to Lane’s blog post the day after the meeting, in which he took a dimmer view on inflation and warned against complacency, suggesting he wanted to amend the agreed policy message, several sources said.\n\nOther signs of the tension, the sources said, were the growing number of leaks from the Governing Council, some of which lack credibility and are designed to steer the debate, rather than reveal it.\n\nOne leak suggested the ECB was contemplating extending emergency powers to its open-ended bond purchase scheme, a notion Yves Mersch, who also heads the ECB’s legal services, rejected.\n\n“No such thing was ever discussed,” a second source said. “Removing limits indefinitely would be a guaranteed way to get us sent back to court.”",

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe pent-up demand is fuelling optimism the Chinese travel industry has reached a turning point, with hopes the eight-day holiday from Oct. 1 will supercharge a tentative pickup seen in recent months, even as some trepidation over the virus lingers.\n\nWhile the world’s second-largest economy is now largely back to normal, though there are still pockets of lingering weakness such as tourism, Capital Economics said in a recent note.\n\nChina’s resurgent travel industry offers a striking contrast to business in some other parts of Asia as well as in the United States and Europe, where the novel coronavirus is still circulating and gatherings are restricted.\n\nThe holiday to mark modern China’s founding is traditionally one of its busiest times for travel, and not just at home. Last year, 782 million trips were made, with more than 7 million people travelling abroad, according to government data.\n\n\"The demand on tourism that was suppressed for nine months will probably be released in these eight days,\" said online travel platform Trip.com TCOM.O in a statement, estimating that 600 million trips could be made.\n\nChina has largely stamped out its coronavirus epidemic, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year, and many restrictions on domestic travel have been lifted.\n\nFew people, however, are expected to venture abroad due to various quarantine requirements around the world and a dearth of overseas flights. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry announced that people should avoid international trips unless “truly necessary” due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut more domestic air bookings were made between Oct. 1 and Sept. 14 than in the year-earlier period, with a surge in August, and economy seats on popular routes, like Beijing to the southwestern city of Lijiang, have sold out, according to travel service provider Qunar.com.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nHotel and airline bookings made during the week of Sept. 8-15 exceeded those made during the same period last year, Alibaba-backed online travel platform Fliggy said, with hotel bookings for Golden Week up by more than 50%.\n\nLONGING TO FLY\n\nSpending on hotels during the holiday is expected to recover to last year's level, or even see slight growth, according to the research department of China's Meituan Dianping 3690.HK, whose on-demand service apps span groceries to hotels.\n\n“People want to fly somewhere, there is this pent-up demand as they’re sick of staying at home,” said Mei Xin, retail analyst at Huatai Securities.\n\nBut still, some coronavirus caution remains.\n\nPeople often have to show health-tracking QR codes, which have played a key part in containing the virus, and some hotels are asking guests to get coronavirus tests before arriving.\n\nAnd some families are being asked to stay at home.\n\nIn cities like Beijing and Shanghai, schools have asked parents and students not to go away for the holidays unless strictly necessary.\n\nBeijing-based television producer Pan Lei, 45, said he felt he had to cancel a family trip to the Yellow Mountain tourist area after getting a notice from his children’s schools.\n\n“I lost the money I paid in advance,” he said.\n\nBut he said it was understandable there were fears of a second coronavirus wave this winter.\n\n“Schools want to cut risks to the minimum.”",

  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing tax-return data.\n\nIn a report that Trump dismissed as “fake news,” the Times said the Republican president also paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017, despite receiving $427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.\n\nThe disclosure of previously private tax information came little more than a month before the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Democrats were quick to seize on the report to paint Trump as a tax dodger and raise questions about his carefully groomed image as a savvy businessman.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to ask Americans to raise their hands if they paid more in federal income tax than Trump.\n\nCalling the report “total fake news” at a White House news conference, Trump again cited an ongoing audit as his reason for not releasing his returns. In a statement to the Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said Trump had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade, without weighing in on the specific finding of minimal income taxes.\n\nTrump’s consistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates. He is currently in a legal battle with New York City prosecutors and congressional Democrats who are seeking to obtain his returns.\n\nHe also previously indicated he preferred to minimize his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him “smart.”\n\nThe Times reported that Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire. It said he claimed $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite saying he had income of at least $434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.\n\nThe Times emphasized the documents reveal only what Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth.\n\nThe Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization. It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.\n\nThe Times also reported that Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service audit over a $72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him in that audit, he could have to pay over $100 million, according to the newspaper.",

REUTERS/Nick Oxford\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Monday but on track for their first monthly fall since April as rising coronavirus cases continued to spur concerns about demand.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 slipped 3 cents to $41.89 a barrel by 1400 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 was at $40.12 a barrel, down 13 cents or 0.3%.\n\n“The rise in daily infections has accelerated and the total number is now very close to 33 million. The most impacted countries are the populous ones,” PVM analyst Tamas Varga said.\n\n“The speed with which the virus is spreading is the main concern for both health officials and financial investors.”\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that the global oil market has been stable for the past few months and the demand-supply balance restored, but warned of the risks of a second wave of COVID-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile one of the heaviest clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 2016 broke out over the weekend, reigniting concern about stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nDespite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies to limit output, more crude is being exported from OPEC producers Iran and Libya.\n\nOPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that commercial oil inventories in OECD countries are expected to stand only slightly above the five-year average in the first quarter of 2021, before falling below that level for the rest of the year.\n\nA factor that may offer some support to the market is the prospect of industrial action in Norway, where a workers’ strike that may take place on Sept. 30 is threatening to cut its production by 900,000 barrels per day, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (NOG) said on Friday.",

  "text": "YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated sharply on Monday in and around the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and at least 30 people were killed in a second day of heavy clashes.\n\nA still image from a video released by the Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry shows members of Azeri armed forces firing artillery during clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in an unidentified location, in this still image from footage released September 28, 2020. Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan/Handout via REUTERS\n\nForces of the two ex-Soviet neighbours pounded each other with rockets and artillery in the fiercest explosion of the decades-old conflict in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nAny move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this since the ceasefire to the war in the 1990s. The fighting is taking place along all sections of the front line,” said Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at Crisis Group.\n\nShe said increased deployment of rockets and artillery brought a higher risk of civilian casualties that could make the escalation hard to stop by diplomatic means.\n\n“If there are mass casualties it will be extremely difficult to contain this fighting and we will definitely see a full-fledged war that will have a potential intervention of Turkey or Russia, or both of them,” Vartanyan said.\n\nMajority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan first clashed in the 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but mostly populated and run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe fighting has revived concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAngela Frangyan, a film maker living in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard. All shops were closed and hardly anyone was in the streets, she said.\n\nERDOGAN DEMAND\n\nTurkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia immediately quit Azeri lands he said it was occupying and said it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nArmenia’s parliament condemned what it said was a “full-scale military attack” by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh. It said Azerbaijan was receiving Turkey’s help, and Ankara’s involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied Turkey was taking part in the fighting.\n\nAuthorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said that 28 of its soldiers had been killed in fighting with Azeri forces on Monday, after saying on Sunday 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported.\n\nThe general prosecutor’s office in Azerbaijan said two Azeri civilians were killed on Monday, after five civilians were killed on Sunday, and 30 civilians had been wounded.\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan’s defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.\n\n“Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy’s positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,” he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken.\n\nFLURRY OF DIPLOMACY\n\nEvyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military’s airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.",

  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Big Hit Entertainment, the management label of hugely popular South Korean K-Pop group BTS, priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its range on Monday, as hopeful buyers chased South Korea’s largest listing in three years.\n\nInstitutional investors expressed interest in more than 1,000 times the number of shares on offer, with Big Hit riding on the success of the seven-member band, which has become the first South Korean group to reach No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with song “Dynamite”.\n\nAn army of retail investors, known in South Korea as Ants, is also clamouring to buy stock, while die-hard BTS fans are bidding in hopes of securing even one share in what analysts expect to the country’ hottest listing this year.\n\nBig Hit priced the IPO at 135,000 won ($115) per share, it said in a regulatory filing, the top of an indicative price range of 105,000-135,000 won announced earlier this month.\n\nSome 1,420 institutional investors sought shares in pre-subscription offers, looking for 1,117 times the number available, the filing said. About 98% said they would pay the top-range price or more.\n\n“Big Hit is classified as a kind of global export firm,” said Park Sung-ho, analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.\n\n“Not only has it proven its ability to use Youtube, social media for smart market infiltration, it has fandom platform Weverse which gives unprecedented clarity and control over its revenue sources for a label, and may grow into a true platform player as outside artists increasingly join.”\n\nBig Hit reported a 49.7 billion won ($42.4 million) profit for the first half of 2020 as its online concert and merchandise sales on the Weverse app more than offset event cancellations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe IPO will make the seven BTS members multimillionaire stockholders, as Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk in August gave them 68,385 shares each, worth nearly $7.9 million at the issue price.\n\nThe firm will raise 962.6 billion won ($820 million) through the offer of 7.13 million new shares, the biggest South Korean IPO since Celltrion Healthcare raised 1 trillion won in 2017.\n\nThe pricing values Big Hit at about 4.8 trillion won, taking into account common shares plus redeemable preferred shares that will be converted into common shares upon the IPO.\n\nWith plenty of liquidity in the market, some analysts predict gross bids from retail investors could hit 100 trillion won ($85 billion).\n\nThe central bank is watching the offer closely as a massive oversubscription for shares could send ripples through short-term money markets.\n\nInstitutional and retail investors’ subscriptions are due on Oct. 5-6 and Big Hit is expected to list on the KOSPI on Oct. 15.\n\n($1 = 1,173.0400 won)",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nShares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa SGREN.MC - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).\n\nA source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.\n\nBy 1352 GMT, shares were trading at 20.86 euros, down 5% from the first trading price, after having traded in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session so far.\n\n“I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. “It’s not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it’s the same with every spin-off.”\n\nSiemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing Lanxess LXSG.DE and Covestro 1COV.DE, which were both spun off from Bayer BAYGn.DE.\n\nFor Siemens AG investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday’s closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.\n\nThomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with General Electric GE.N and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, will be valued.\n\nSpun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.\n\nThat should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group’s production plants.\n\nSiemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.\n\n“We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,” Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.\n\nSiemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.",

Transport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a \"pattern of failures\", including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.\n\nUber argued it has since assuaged concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.\n\nThe U.S. company was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017, in a major blow in one of its most important markets, before it was restored on a probationary basis.\n\n“I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,” Judge Tan Ikram said on Monday.\n\n“Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London... operator’s licence,” he said, granting an 18-month right to take rides.\n\nUber, which has apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into backlashes and regulatory challenges elsewhere, including in its home state of California.\n\nShares in Uber rose 6% in pre-market U.S. trading after the decision.\n\n“This decision is a recognition of Uber’s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s boss for Northern and Eastern Europe, said.\n\nIn London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt.\n\nThe city’s traditional black cab drivers have blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also chairs TfL, warned Uber on Monday to stick to its obligations.\n\n“I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers,” he said in a statement.",

I did it and I shouldn’t have, it was the biggest mistake I did in my career,” Wilander told Eurosport.\n\n“I think Murray needs to stop thinking of himself and start thinking about who he was. Does he have a right to be out there taking wild cards from the young players?”\n\nAustralian Kyrgios, who has skipped the French Open because of the coronavirus pandemic, quickly jumped to the defence of the 33-year-old British player on Twitter.\n\n“Just read what Wilander said about @andy_murray... shut up Mats, no one cares. Muzz, just know that however long you stay, we all appreciate and enjoy your tennis and banter.\n\n“Also I’ve never watched a point of Mats Wilander.”\n\nMurray returned to singles action last year and won the title in Antwerp where he beat Wawrinka, a result that raised hopes he could again challenge at the top.\n\nHowever, the three-time Grand Slam winner looked a pale shadow of himself on Sunday and admitted after the match that he would have a good hard think about his game.\n\n“It’s tough to quit, for sure. By giving us all hope by playing, it’s just not right,” Wilander said. “I love the fact that he is back and trying.\n\n“Hopefully he’ll figure out why he’s doing it.”\n\nWilander’s Eurosport colleague Alex Corretja, a former coach of Murray, said he respected Wilander’s opinion but said Murray needs to be given a chance to enjoy the rest of his career.\n\n“My advice is to retire one year too late rather than one year too early,” Spaniard Corretja said. “I believe that once the indoors season starts he will feel much better.”",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nBritain left the EU in January but is currently in a status-quo transition period, which ends on December 31 irrespective of whether or not a deal is agreed. On Monday, the two sides started a decisive week of talks, with one diplomat noting an improvement in “mood music”.\n\nBut all six banks which participated in a Reuters poll in June are more pessimistic, with most citing UK legislation that would breach parts of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU in January.\n\nThe move has drawn threats of legal action from the EU.\n\nThe most dramatic re-assessment was by Societe Generale, which said the bill “gravely damaged” trust. The probability of no-deal now stands at 80%, according to the bank, which had assigned a 17% chance in June.\n\nGermany’s Commerzbank, meanwhile, puts the probability of no-deal at slightly below 50%, versus 10% in June, a scenario which strategist Thu Lan Nguyen warns could hit the pound hard, possibly resulting in depreciation of “something around 10%”.\n\nThe currency has fallen around 5% this month but with three months still to go before the transition period expires, options markets are pricing in more volatility ahead.\n\nING now believes the risk of no deal is 50%, up from 40% three months ago. Only a small proportion of this risk premium is priced by sterling, according to economist James Smith, who sees the currency possibly heading towards parity versus the euro.\n\n(Graphic: How likely is a no-deal Brexit? - )\n\n(Interactive version here of banks' Brexit forecasts)\n\nIn a more detailed forecast, Standard Chartered stuck with a one-in-two chance of an agreement by the end of the year but also saw a 20% chance of the transition period being extended and a 30% chance of exiting without a deal.\n\nJPMorgan, not included in the Reuters poll, expects the worst-case outcome to wipe at least three percentage points off UK gross domestic product in 2021.\n\nIt puts the risk of no-deal at one-in-three but told clients that “with brinkmanship part of the process it may appear higher than that before agreement is reached”.",

REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\n“For me, I see the effective lower bound still at 0.1 which is where Bank Rate is at present,” Ramsden said in an interview with Britain’s Society of Professional Economists posted online.\n\nSterling extended its rise against the dollar and the euro after his comments.\n\nThe BoE said this month it would look at how it might be able to implement negative rates if they were needed, building on an announcement in August that the option was part of its toolbox.\n\nOne of the BoE’s nine interest-rate setters, Silvana Tenreyro, said in a newspaper interview published on Saturday that the investigation into whether negative rates might help the economy had found “encouraging” evidence.\n\nRamsden said in his interview with the SPE that there were some jurisdictions where negative rates appeared more effective than in the euro zone and Japan, but their usefulness depended on the economic cycle and the structure of the banking system.\n\nThe BoE cut interest rates to a record-low 0.1% in March, and until this year it had always ruled out negative rates, saying they would hurt Britain’s banks and building society lenders.\n\nBut the scale of the COVID-19 hit to the economy, and the possibility of Britain failing to strike a trade deal with the European Union, have forced the BoE to reconsider.\n\nRamsden said interest rates on households’ bank deposits tended not to fall below zero when central banks pushed their benchmark rates into negative territory - which could hurt banks as the gap between lending and funding rates would narrow.\n\nBritain’s banks were also likely to be hit by higher loan losses soon as borrowers struggle to cope with the coronavirus hit, he added.\n\nThat represented a different phase of the economic cycle to when the European Central Bank introduced negative rates, which took place during a recovery phase.\n\nRamsden said the BoE was not going to use negative rates soon and engagement with banks on the possible change would take time, echoing comments from his colleagues.\n\n“We are not about to use them imminently. It will take time to do this work,” he said.\n\nRamsden also said he was focused on the risk that unemployment could rise further than the central case in the BoE’s most recent forecasts.\n\n“For me, when we’re looking at unemployment, it is more likely that unemployment will end up peaking higher than 7.5% than lower, and it will end up coming down more gradually,” he said.\n\nOfficial figures show unemployment of 4.1% for the three months to June.",

REUTERS/Omar Sobhani/Files\n\nHERAT/KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan woman Laleh Osmany has been campaigning for years for a change to the age-old custom of officially identifying people by the names of their fathers, calling for mothers’ names to be included on identity cards.\n\nBut her “Where Is My Name?” campaign, which finally brought a change in the law last week, has stirred heated debate in the conservative Muslim country where for some, speaking a woman’s name in public is taboo.\n\nThe Taliban, who have just begun power-sharing talks with the Afghan government that could see them return to rule in some capacity, have opposed the reform in one of the first concrete stances they have revealed on women’s rights as they engage in the peace process.\n\n“From the beginning of this campaign until now, we’ve encountered insults, humiliation, threats,” said Osmany, a 28-year old religious studies graduate.\n\nFor Osmany and many other Afghan women, a mother’s name beside the father’s on identity cards represents the rightful recognition of women in society.\n\n“This right has been given to us by Islam ... we want to take back our rights.”\n\nOsmany’s campaign, which she launched on social media in 2017, paid off last week when President Ashraf Ghani signed an amendment that would recognise mothers equally with fathers on identification cards.\n\nBut along with the recognition from the president and the support of many woman, the reform has provoked anger.\n\n“The inclusion of the mother’s name on electronic IDs would be a disgrace and a dishonour for Afghans,” Said Akbar Agha, who served as an official during Taliban rule, told a gathering to discuss reconciliation in the city of Herat last week.\n\n‘CHANGE IS DIFFICULT’\n\nWomen’s rights have improved significantly since the hardline Taliban were forced from power in 2001.\n\nBut concern is growing about the prospects for sustaining that progress with the possibility of a return of the Islamist group to a role in government.\n\nThe Taliban say they have changed and would allow education for girls and women to work outside the home, in some circumstances.\n\nBut when pushed for details such as on whether women would be required to wear a face covering or work in jobs alongside men, they say the rights of women would be decided according to Islamic sharia, though without specifying how.\n\nMany women harbour deep mistrust and doubt the sincerity of reassuring Taliban comments.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the group opposed putting the names of mothers on identify cards.\n\n“From a religious point of view, the names of women are among the prohibitions that cannot be mentioned anywhere,” Mujahid told Reuters.\n\n“Mentioning the names of mothers, wives, sisters and daughters is not culturally tolerable in our society,” he said.\n\nIn a later message to Reuters to clarify his comment, Mujahid said: “Naming someone’s wife or mother is also part of a family’s or someone’s privacy, and if they don’t want that and consider this taboo or shame, then from sharia and a cultural point of view, it is a valid reason and no one should interfere.”\n\nOsmany said she was disappointed by the Taliban position but would not stop fighting for the recognition of women even though she was worried about her safety and that of her colleagues.\n\n“We’re not doing anything wrong, so we’ll continue this struggle so that we can revive the identity of women,” she said.\n\n“We know change is difficult, it’s difficult to change society but when we start working, we must not be afraid of obstacles and we should never give up.”",

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n\nBerlin (Reuters) - Bei der Suche nach einem Atommüll-Endlager für Deutschland scheidet das niedersächsische Gorleben aus, dafür rücken weite Teile Bayerns in den Blickpunkt.\n\nDie Bundesgesellschaft für Endlagerung (BGE) schloss in ihrem am Montag veröffentlichten Zwischenbericht die Gesteinsschichten unter Gorleben als instabil aus: “Der Salzstock Gorleben wird daher nicht bei den weiteren Arbeiten der BGE zu den Vorschlägen über die Standortregionen betrachtet.” Dafür kommt unter anderem Bayern in die Diskussion, da das Granitgestein dort grundsätzlich als geeignet für ein unterirdisches Lager für hochradioaktiven Müll genannt wird. Bayerns Ministerpräsident Markus Söder kritisierte den Auswahlprozess scharf und nannte den Ausschluss Gorlebens unverständlich. Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze warnte hingegen vor politischem Einfluss: “Das Verfahren ist gut, es verdient Vertrauen.”\n\nDie BGE hat allein aufgrund der geologischen Bedingungen rund 90 mögliche Standorte in Ton-, Salz- und kristallinen Gesteinsformationen wie Granit aufgelistet. Andere Kriterien wie Besiedlung oder Bebauung spielten in diesem ersten Schritt noch keine Rolle. Die BGE hält Deutschland insgesamt als Standort für geeignet: “Deutschland ist gesegnet mit einer guten Geologie”, sagte Geschäftsführer Steffen Kanitz. Eine Abstufung zwischen den genannten Regionen und Gesteinsformationen wurde noch nicht vorgenommen. In weiteren Phasen wird die Auswahl weiter eingeschränkt, so dass bis 2031 die Entscheidung für den Standort fallen soll. Für 2050 ist geplant, das Endlager in Betrieb zu nehmen. In jedem Schritt bis zur Festlegung des Standortes sollen Bürger angehört und beteiligt werden. Überwacht wird der Prozess zudem durch ein sogenanntes nationales Begleitgremium mit Wissenschaftlern und anderen Berufsgruppen.\n\nNeben Bayern und anderen Gebieten in Niedersachsen hat die Endlager-Gesellschaft auch Baden-Württemberg sowie große Teile Ostdeutschlands auf der Liste. Das Saarland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und Teile des Ruhrgebiets finden sich dagegen dort nicht. Dieses scheidet wegen der zahlreichen alten Bergwerke aus, die das Gebiet geologisch unsicher machen. Insgesamt kommt in dieser Phase mehr als die Hälfte Deutschlands grundsätzlich als Standort infrage.\n\nSÖDER STELLT PROZESS INFRAGE - SCHULZE WARNT\n\nBayerns Ministerpräsident Söder kritisierte: “Wenn man breit angelegt diskutieren möchte, bleibt die Frage, warum man Gorleben fundamental ausschließt”, sagte er. Die BGE habe dies nicht ausreichend begründet. Er verwies darauf, dass nun zwei Drittel von Bayern als grundsätzlich geeignet gelte und deutschlandweit mehr als die Hälfte der Fläche. “Ich befürchte, dass sehr viele Menschen jetzt sehr verunsichert sind.” Unverständlich nannte es Söder auch, dass ein Endlager für eine Million Jahre ausgelegt werden soll. Das sei eine “mutige und interessante Einschätzung”. Die Gesteinsart Granit, die vor allem in Bayern vorkommt, sei dafür jedenfalls nicht sinnvoll.\n\nBundesumweltministerin Schulze forderte, politische Motive dürften die Suche nicht beeinflussen, es müsse streng nach Wissenschaftlichkeit vorgegangen werden. “Nur so kann es am Ende Akzeptanz für einen Endlagerstandort geben – egal, wo er dann in der Republik liegen wird”, sagte die SPD-Politikerin. Die Umweltorganisation BUND verlangte eine stärkere Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit und Geld, um die Daten und Fakten überprüfen zu können. Die Anti-Atom-Organisation “ausgestrahlt” bemängelte, schon die Prozess-Kriterien seien politisch ausgehandelt worden. Daher ließen diese großen Spielraum für Interpretationen, sagte Sprecher Jochen Stay. “Neuer politischer Streit ist deshalb vorprogrammiert.”\n\nNach dem das geplante Endlager Gorleben nach heftigen Protesten nicht weiter verfolgt wurde, hatten Bund und Länder 2017 eine komplett neue Suche mit weißer Landkarte gestartet - kein Gebiet sollte von vornherein ausgeschlossen sein. Wenn Ende 2022 das letzte AKW vom Netz geht, wird etwa 27.000 Kubikmeter hochradioaktiver Müll bleiben. Er soll in einer Tiefe von mindestens 300 Metern und einer Gesteinsschicht mit mindestens 100 Metern Mächtigkeit entstehen. Für den Müll wird ein Raum mit lediglich 30 mal 30 mal 30 Metern gebraucht. Von der gesamten Atommüll-Menge gelten nur 5 Prozent als hochradioaktiv. Auf dies entfällt jedoch 99 Prozent der gefährlichen Strahlung. Derzeit ist dieser Müll noch in Zwischenlagern, häufig an AKW-Standorten, direkt untergebracht. Von den Kosten für die Atommüll-Lagerung haben sich die Atomkonzerne mit einer Zahlung von gut 24 Milliarden Euro befreit, die jetzt in einem staatlichen Fonds angelegt sind.",

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\nBerlin (Reuters) - Die Lufthansa hat mit Vertretern der Piloten und des Bodenpersonals über die kritische Lage des Konzerns in der Corona-Krise beraten.\n\n“Die Gewerkschaften wurden eingestimmt auf weitere Opfer und das Management hat das Zukunftsszenario in dunkelsten Farben gemalt”, sagte Marcel Gröls, der bei der Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) für Tarifpolitik zuständig ist, am Montag der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. “Wir wurden eingeschworen auf noch härtere Zeiten.” Eine Verdi-Sprecherin sagte, es sei klar, dass Kündigungen allein nicht reichten. Die Lufthansa müsse Perspektiven in der Krise aufzeigen und Maßnahmen zum sozialverträglichen Jobabbau so schnell wie möglich angehen. “Eine Restrukturierung ist notwendig.”\n\nBeim sogenannten “strategischen Dialog” trifft sich die Lufthansa regelmäßig mit den Vertretern der Belegschaft. Die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft UFO hatte allerdings abgesagt und dies damit begründet, dass es keinen Fortschritt bei noch offenen Fragen zu ihrem Krisen-Tarifvertrag mit der Lufthansa gebe. UFO hatte im Juni einen Krisenpakt mit der auf neun Milliarden Euro Staatshilfe angewiesenen Lufthansa geschlossen. Mit Verdi ist noch keine Einigung für das Bodenpersonal gelungen, mit der Pilotengewerkschaft VC nur eine Übergangslösung. Noch in dieser Woche sollen Gespräche starten, um längerfristige Lösungen zu finden, sagte VC-Experte Gröls.\n\nBeim Treffen mit der Lufthansa wurden die Gewerkschaften nach eigenen Angaben auch damit konfrontiert, dass der künftige Personalüberhang um rund 5000 höher ausfällt als mit 22.000 bisher geplant. Der Großteil dürfte das Kabinenpersonal treffen. Erst am Freitag hatte die Lufthansa erklärt, dass ab 2022 mindestens 1100 Stellen bei den Piloten gefährdet sind. Ende Juni hatte die Lufthansa Group insgesamt rund 129.000 Mitarbeiter. Wegen der deutlich langsameren Erholung des Luftverkehrs von der Pandemie verschärft die Fluglinie ihren Sparkurs. So soll die Flotte von Lufthansa und den anderen Konzern-Airlines bis zu dem erst für Mitte des Jahrzehnts erwarteten Ende der Krise um 150 Maschinen auf rund 650 Flugzeuge schrumpfen, um 50 mehr als bislang vorgesehen. Darin sind geleaste Maschinen anderer Airlines eingerechnet.",

Mehrere internationale Institutionen hätten die in Deutschland gewonnenen Erkenntnisse zu der Vergiftung des Oppositionellen bestätigt: “Und deshalb fordern wir Russland auf, bei der Aufklärung mitzuarbeiten”, sagte der Bundesfinanzminister.\n\nIn Europa stehen derzeit Forderungen nach EU-Sanktionen gegen Russland im Zusammenhang mit der Vergiftung Nawalnys im Raum. Die Bundesregierung hatte nicht mehr ausgeschlossen, dass davon auch die Gaspipeline Nord Stream 2 betroffen sein könnte. Scholz bekräftigte seine Sicht, dass es sich bei der Ostseepipeline von Russland nach Mecklenburg-Vorpommern um ein privatwirtschaftliches Projekt handele, das seine Funktion für die künftige Energieversorgung Deutschlands habe: “Es erhöht nicht die Abhängigkeit Deutschlands, sondern es reduziert sie.”\n\nNawalny hat das Krankenhaus inzwischen verlassen. Er war am 20. August auf einem russischen Inlandsflug zusammengebrochen und nach einer Notlandung zunächst im sibirischen Omsk behandelt worden. Am 22. August wurde er zur Behandlung in der Charite ausgeflogen.

Die gesetzliche Regelung sei klar: Storniere ein Anbieter bereits bezahlte Flüge, müsse er seine Kunden darüber informieren, dass sie ihr Geld zurückfordern oder freiwillig einen Gutschein annehmen könnten, erklärten die Verbraucherschützer. Wenn sich Reisende für die Rückzahlung entschieden, müsse das Unternehmen binnen sieben Tagen den Flugpreis erstatten. “Verbraucherbeschwerden zeigen jedoch, dass sich die Lufthansa derzeit kaum an diese Regelungen hält und Rückzahlungen verschleiert und verschleppt.”\n\nDa sich das Unternehmen weigere, eine Unterlassungserklärung abzugeben, reiche man nun Klage vor dem Landgericht Köln ein, hieß es. Die Lufthansa lehnte einen Kommentar ab und verwies darauf, noch keine Klage erhalten zu haben. Deutschlands größte Fluglinie muss mit neun Milliarden Euro Staatshilfen gerettet werden, da der Flugbetrieb wegen der Virus-Pandemie eingebrochen ist. Grund sind fehlende Umsätze und Liquiditätsengpässe, die auch durch die Rückzahlungen ausgelöst werden. Die Lufthansa, aber auch andere Airlines oder Reiseveranstalter stehen in der Kritik, die Erstattungen zu langsam zu zahlen. Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr hatte sich bereits dafür entschuldigt.\n\nDie für Verbraucherschutz zuständige Bundesjustizministerin Christine Lambrecht hatte schon im August betont: “Die Airlines dürfen die Geduld der Kunden jetzt nicht überstrapazieren und ihr Vertrauen nicht aufs Spiel setzen.” Die Verpflichtung, die Tickets sehr zügig zu erstatten, sei “glasklar” europarechtlich vorgeschrieben. “Dieser Pflicht müssen alle Fluggesellschaften jetzt endlich nachkommen.”\n\nMitte September hatte die Lufthansa erklärt, es gebe noch 900.000 offene Anträge auf Erstattung.

  "text": "Frankfurt/München (Reuters) - Für die Siemens-Aktionäre hat sich die Abspaltung der Energietechnik-Sparte schon gelohnt.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The headquarters of Siemens AG is seen in Munich, Germany, December 18, 2019. REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nDer Wert ihres Depots ist zum Börsendebüt von Siemens Energy am Montag um sieben Prozent gewachsen. Dafür war aber weniger der verhaltene Start von Siemens Energy verantwortlich. Die Börsianer bewerteten den neuen Konzern mit 91.000 Mitarbeitern zum ersten Kurs von 22,01 Euro mit 16 Milliarden Euro - weniger als die Analysten ihm im Schnitt zugetraut haben und weniger als der Buchwert, den die Wirtschaftsprüfer beim “Spin-off” im März ermittelt hatten. Sie setzen vielmehr auf die verbleibende Siemens AG, deren Aktie trotz der Abspaltung von einem Drittel des Geschäfts mit einem Kurs von 109 Euro kaum nachgab. Ihre Anteilseigner haben aber für je zwei Siemens-Aktien zusätzlich ein Siemens-Energy-Papier im Depot.\n\nDie Siemens-Energy-Aktien schwankten zum Börsenstart heftig zwischen 19,21 und 22,98 Euro. Die Berg- und Talfahrt dürfte in den nächsten Wochen weitergehen. Denn nicht nur Dax-Indexfonds müssen sich von Siemens-Energy-Aktien trennen, weil das Unternehmen mit der Bewertung zunächst nur Chancen auf den Nebenwerteindex MDax hat. Auch Technologie-Investoren dürften aussteigen. Insgesamt könnten 35 Prozent der Papiere in nächster Zeit den Besitzer wechseln. “Frühestens Mitte Oktober” werde man sehen, wie die Börse Siemens Energy wirklich bewerte, sagte Siemens-Finanzvorstand Ralf Thomas.\n\nDie Siemens AG konzentriert sich mit 240.000 Mitarbeitern auf ihre margenstarken Geschäfte mit der Automatisierung von Fabriken, auf Infrastruktur- und Gebäudetechnik sowie auf Züge und kann den Anlegern damit höhere Renditen versprechen. Zudem hält sie 79 Prozent an der Medizintechnik-Tochter Siemens Healthineers, die an der Börse allein 40 Milliarden Euro wert ist. Damit sind nun drei Unternehmen mit dem Namen Siemens an der Frankfurter Börse notiert.\n\nDie Strategie des scheidenden Vorstandschefs Joe Kaeser, den Mischkonzern aufzuspalten, hat sich vorerst ausgezahlt. Er hegt seit langem den Verdacht, dass Siemens an der Börse unter einem Konglomeratsabschlag leidet. Analysten veranschlagen ihn auf mehr als ein Viertel. “Die eigenständigen Börsennotierungen werden die Wertschaffungspotenziale der jeweiligen Geschäfte deutlich besser als im Konglomerat erschließen können”, sagte Kaeser.\n\nKEINE GROSSEN ÜBERNAHMEN AUF DER AGENDA\n\nAus dem Mischkonzern soll ein Technologieunternehmen werden, wie der künftige Siemens-Chef Roland Busch bekräftigte: “Nach dem weitgehenden Abschluss der strukturellen Weiterentwicklung werden wir jetzt unseren Fokus konsequent auf die digitale Transformation des Unternehmens legen.” Vor allem in der Bau- und Gebäudetechnik sieht er da Nachholbedarf. Große Übernahmen stehen in den nächsten Jahren nicht auf der Tagesordnung, zumal die Ratingagenturen klar signalisiert haben, dass sie einer höheren Verschuldung kritisch gegenüberstünden. Finanzvorstand Thomas unterstrich in Frankfurt, dass auch die Zug-Sparte Siemens Mobility nach der geplatzten Fusion mit Alstom Teil des Konzerns bleibe. “Mobility kann sich sehr gut weiter so bewegen. Wir werden aber weiter nach links und rechts schauen.”\n\nFür Siemens-Energy-Chef Christian Bruch geht es kurzfristig darum, das Geschäft mit Turbinen für Gas- und Kohlekraftwerke, aber auch mit Windanlagen in die Gewinnzone zurückzuführen. Mittelfristig geht es um nichts weniger als die Energiewende. “Als eigenständiger Konzern haben wir nun die notwendige unternehmerische Flexibilität, um die weltweite Transformation der Energiemärkte nachhaltig und wirtschaftlich erfolgreich mitzugestalten”, sagte Bruch. Der Ausstieg aus dem Bau neuer Kohlekraftwerke ist vorgezeichnet. Der größte Hoffnungsträger ist die spanische Wind-Tochter Siemens Gamesa, die wegen des Preiskampfs in der Branche aber ebenfalls rote Zahlen schreibt. Die 67-Prozent-Beteiligung an Gamesa ist allein knapp zehn Milliarden Euro wert.\n\nGRÖSSTER SPIN-OFF IN DEUTSCHLAND\n\nAnders als bei Healthineers war Kaeser bei Siemens Energy daran gelegen, die Mehrheit sofort abzugeben. Man habe Siemens Energy finanziell so aufgestellt, dass es “von Tag eins auf eigenen Füßen stehen kann”, sagte Thomas. 55 Prozent der Aktien liegen nun bei den eigenen Aktionären, 9,9 Prozent übernahm der Siemens-Pensionsfonds. Die restlichen 35,1 Prozent sollen binnen zwölf bis 18 Monaten weiter abschmelzen. Doch wolle Siemens für etwa fünf Jahre eine Sperrminorität behalten, zumal der Konzern für mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro an Verträgen von Siemens Energy bürge, sagte Thomas. “In dieser Zeit möchte ich für die Siemens AG ein gewisses Mitentscheidungsrecht haben.”\n\nSiemens Energy ist der größte “Spin-off” eines Dax-Konzerns. Zuvor hatte Bayer auf dem selben Weg Lanxess und Covestro als eigenständige Unternehmen an die Börse gebracht. E.ON trennte sich von Uniper. Auch Siemens hat mit Abspaltungen Erfahrung: 2013 waren die Aktien von Osram an die eigenen Anteilseigner verteilt worden. Ähnliches plant Siemens nächstes Jahr mit der Getriebetochter Flender, hält sich aber einen Verkauf an einen Investor offen.",

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nBerlin (Reuters) - Der Bund muss sich wegen der Corona-Krise in diesem Jahr so viel Geld von Investoren leihen wie noch nie.\n\nInsgesamt will er sich rund 407 Milliarden Euro am Finanzmarkt holen, wie die für das Schuldenmanagement zuständige Finanzagentur am Montag mitteilte. Ende 2019 - also vor Ausbruch der Pandemie - waren maximal 218 Milliarden Euro angepeilt worden. “Es ist ein nie dagewesenes Emissionsvolumen aufgrund der außergewöhnlichen Umstände”, sagte Finanzagentur-Geschäftsführer Tammo Diemer. Allein im bevorstehenden vierten Quartal will der Bund 50,5 Milliarden Euro mit der Ausgabe von Wertpapieren auftreiben - sechs Milliarden mehr als urspünglich veranschlagt. Hinzu kommen noch etwa 1,5 Milliarden Euro an inflationsgekoppelten Bonds.\n\nDie Corona-Rezession hat sämtliche Finanzplanungen des Bundes über den Haufen geworfen. Sie sorgt für enorme Steuerausfälle. Zugleich gibt die Regierung viel Geld aus, um die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Krise abzumildern. Mit den Emissionen soll die Differenz zwischen Einnahmen und Ausgaben ausgeglichen werden. Zugleich müssen auch noch 248 Milliarden Euro Altschulden getilgt werden.\n\nNach der erfolgreichen Premiere der ersten grünen Anleihe will der Bund diesen Bereich im November um ein neues Produkt erweitern. Dann sei der Verkauf eines Green Bonds mit einer Laufzeit von fünf Jahren geplant, sagte Diemer. Die Auktion soll fünf Milliarden Euro in die Kassen von Finanzminister Olaf Scholz spülen. 2021 soll dieses junge Segment weiter ausgebaut werden. Diemer liebäugelt hier mit einer grünen Anleihe mit 30 Jahren Laufzeit.\n\nDer Bund hat seine erste grüne Anleihe am 2. September an Investoren verkauft. Das Emissionsvolumen des Papieres mit einer Laufzeit von zehn Jahren wurde auf 6,5 Milliarden Euro festgelegt. Die Nachfrage übertraf das Angebot um gut das Fünffache. Die Papiere seien “einen Schnaps teurer” als konventionelle Anleihen. “Investoren waren bereit, auf ein bisschen Rendite zu verzichten”, sagte Diemer.\n\nDas eingesammelte Kapital soll konkreten Energie- und Umweltprojekten zugewiesen werden, die zum nachhaltigen und klimafreundlichen Umbau der Wirtschaft beitragen sollen. “Klimaschutz und Umweltschutz sind die großen Herausforderungen unserer Zeit, die können wir nur gemeinsam stemmen”, sagte Scholz zum Start des Kongresses “European Sustainable Finance Summit”. “Dazu müssen wir das Geld in die richtigen Bahnen lenken und dem Finanzmarkt einen nachhaltigen Impuls geben.”\n\nBei der Premiere der ersten grünen Anleihe hatte die Finanzagentur Investmentbanken eingespannt, um die Papiere zu verkaufen - wie auch bei zwei anderen Anleiheemissionen in diesem Jahr, wofür die Banken 29 Millionen Euro an Gebühren einstrichen. Man habe sich für diesen Weg entschieden, “weil wir ein hohes Emissionsvolumen in diesem Jahr sicher umsetzen wollten”, wie Diemer sagte. Auktionen - bei denen keine Gebühren fällig werden - blieben aber das Standardverfahren.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nLondon/Brüssel (Reuters) - Großbritannien strebt bis Mitte 2021 ein Handelsabkommen mit den USA an.\n\nDies sei aber keine fixe Vorgabe, sagte die britische Handelsministerin Liz Truss am Montag bei einer Veranstaltung. Für das geplante Abkommen gebe es von beiden Seiten bereits Formulierungsvorschläge, die nun aber noch gegenseitig abgestimmt werden müssten. Es werde also das Fundament für eine Einigung gelegt. “Natürlich wollen wir so viel Fortschritte wie möglich vor den US-Wahlen machen.” Diese stehen Anfang November an.\n\nTruss ergänzte, Großbritannien werde nach dem EU-Austritt im Handel künftig unabhängiger von der Europäischen Union werden. Der Trend werde stärker zu Regionen und Ländern gehen, die schneller wachsen würden.\n\nDie EU und Großbritannien verhandeln diese Woche in der vorerst letzten Gesprächsrunde über die künftigen Beziehungen nach dem Brexit. Ab Dienstag stehen in Brüssel Handelsgespräche der Verhandlungsführer - Michel Barnier für die EU und David Frost für das Vereinigte Königreich - an. Diese sind bis Freitag angesetzt. Nach EU-Angaben muss bis Ende Oktober, spätestens Anfang November eine Einigung stehen, die Anfang 2021 in Kraft treten kann und die zuvor noch zahlreiche Parlamente ratifizieren müssen. Denn die Übergangszeit für Großbritannien, in der noch EU-Regeln angewendet werden müssen, endet an Silvester.\n\nAm Donnerstag und Freitag beraten die Staats- und Regierungschefs der EU. Es wird erwartet, dass sie grünes Licht für weitere Verhandlungen mit Großbritannien geben werden. Ein Freihandelsabkommen mit dem Königreich ist vor allem für die exportabhängige deutsche Wirtschaft wichtig. Die Vorstellungen der britischen Seite seien noch weit von dem entfernt, was die EU akzeptieren könne, so EU-Kommissionsvize Maros Sefcovic. Es müsse dringend ein Gang höher geschaltet werden. Ein Sprecher des britischen Premierministers Boris Johnson sagte, eine Einigung sei trotz bestehender Differenzen noch möglich. Es gebe aber noch viel zu tun.",

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nFrankfurt (Reuters) - Schnäppchenjäger haben den europäischen Börsen den besten Tag seit einem Vierteljahr beschert.\n\nDer Dax kletterte am Montag um 3,1 Prozent auf 12.861 Punkte, der EuroStoxx50 zog 2,7 Punkte auf 3220 Zähler an. So groß fiel das Plus zuletzt vor ungefähr drei Monaten aus. Auch in den USA signalisierten die Futures einen festeren Handelsauftakt. Börsianer verwiesen darauf, dass sich nach den kräftigen Verlusten der vergangenen Woche Schnäppchenjäger mit Aktien eindeckten.\n\nAuch am Devisenmarkt blendeten die Anleger die Risiken aus, der Dollar gab zu einem Währungskorb 0,5 Prozent nach, der Euro legte zu. Allerdings stünden die Börsen vor turbulenten Zeiten: “Die Anzahl der Risiken steigt und die Achterbahnfahrt an den Börsen dürfte eher noch rasanter werden”, sagte Milan Cutcovic, Marktanalyst beim Brokerhaus AxiTrader. Die größte Sorge der Börsianer sei, dass die Corona-Pandemie außer Kontrolle gerate und strengere Restriktionen folgten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel warnte vor einem massiven Anstieg der Infektionszahlen. Das Infektionsgeschehen müsse schnell eingedämmt werden. Am Dienstag steht eine Videokonferenz der Kanzlerin mit den Ministerpräsidenten der Bundesländer an.\n\nAnleger trösteten sich mit Daten, dass die Gewinne der chinesischen Industriekonzerne im August zum vierten Mal in Folge gestiegen sind. Das ließ auf eine nachhaltige Erholung hoffen und schürte vor allem die Nachfrage bei Sektoren, die stark am Tropf der Auftragslage in der Volksrepublik hängen. Der europäische Auto-Index zog um 3,5 Prozent an, der Industrie-Index gewann 2,7 Prozent. Auch das wichtige Industriemetall Kupfer war gefragt und kostete mit 6625 Dollar je Tonne 1,2 Prozent mehr.\n\nUm mehr als fünf Prozent aufwärts ging es für den Bankenindex des STOXX 600. Er war zum Wochenschluss auf ein neues Allzeittief gefallen. Positiv kam unter anderem die Ernennung des Deutsche-Bank-Managers Manfred Knof zum neuen Commerzbank-Chef an, die Aktien legten 5,7 Prozent zu. “Die Nominierung legt den Grundstein für den Umbau der Commerzbank”, sagte ein Händler. Für Enthusiasmus sei es aber noch zu früh. Da der neue Chef erst im Januar das Ruder übernehme, werde der Umbau noch eine Weile auf sich warten lassen.\n\nIm Dax gehörten die Aktien der Deutschen Bank mit einem Kursplus von bis zu 6,8 Prozent zu den größten Gewinnern. An der Börse in London war vor allem das britische Geldhaus HSBC gefragt. Die Anteilsscheine kletterten bis zu 11,5 Prozent, nachdem der größte Anteilseigner, der chinesische Internet-Versicherungsriese Pin An seine Beteiligung auf acht Prozent aufgestockt hat. In den vergangenen Monaten hatten Investoren einen großen Bogen um Bankaktien gemacht. Auf den Magen schlug ihnen niedrige Zinsen, zunehmend notleidende Kredite und ein Geldwäscheskandal. “Es gibt eine Chance für eine taktische Neugewichtung, aber keine strukturelle Erholung der Banken”, betonte daher Dhaval Joshi, Investmentstratege bei BCA Research.\n\nSIEMENS ENERGY VORÜBERGEHEND 31. WERT IM DAX\n\nAn der Frankfurter Börse legte Siemens Energy ein verhaltenes Börsendebüt hin. Die abgespaltene Energietechnik-Sparte von Siemens startete mit einem Aktienkurs von 22,01 Euro und war nur für diesen Tag das 31. Mitglied im Dax. Damit kommt das rote Zahlen schreibende Unternehmen auf einen Börsenwert von 16 Milliarden Euro, weit weniger als die Analysten ihm im Schnitt zugetraut haben. Für die Siemens-Aktionäre ging die Abspaltung dennoch auf. Sie hatten 55 Prozent der Siemens-Energy-Aktien übers Wochenende ins Depot gebucht bekommen - je eine für zwei Siemens-Papiere. Die Siemens-Aktie setzte sich mit einem Plus von bis zu 9,3 Prozent an die Dax-Spitze - allerdings ist der Kurs bereinigt um die Siemens-Energy-Aktie.",

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nFrankfurt (Reuters) - Die Furcht vor neuerlichen Einschränkungen für das öffentliche Leben in Europa im Kampf gegen die Coronavirus-Pandemie hat Europas Anleger zum Wochenschluss verschreckt.\n\n“Neben Reisewarnungen ist es vor allem die Gefahr von Lockdowns, welche die Wirtschaft ausbremsen könnte”, sagte Analyst Timo Emden von Emden Research. Der Dax verlor am Freitag 1,4 Prozent auf 12.426 Punkte und steuert damit auf einen Wochenverlust von mehr als fünf Prozent zu - das ist das größte Minus seit mehr als drei Monaten. Der EuroStoxx50 gab 1,3 Prozent nach auf 3119 Zähler. In den USA signalisierten die Futures ebenfalls einen schwächeren Handelsstart.\n\nFür Gesprächsstoff sorgten die Bemühungen um ein weiteres Konjunkturpaket in den USA. “Die Demokraten wollen einen neuen Vorschlag präsentieren und Verhandlungen starten”, sagte Marktanalyst Milan Cutkovic vom Brokerhaus AxiTrader. “Die Chancen auf einen Deal vor der Präsidentenwahl im November sind zwar weiterhin gering, aber die Börsen reagieren positiv auf jeden noch so kleinen Fortschritt.” Vom billionenschweren Corona-Hilfspaket sind nach Angaben von Finanzminister Steven Mnuchin und Notenbankchef Jerome Powell immer noch etwa 380 Milliarden Dollar ungenutzt.\n\nAllerdings machen es die wachsenden Spannungen zwischen regierenden Republikanern und den oppositionellen Demokraten unwahrscheinlich, dass sich beide Seiten noch vor der Präsidentenwahl am 3. November auf ein neues Hilfspaket einigen. Ricardo Evangelista, Analyst beim Brokerhaus ActivTrades verwies auch auf die langsamere Erholung der Wirtschaft. “Kurzfristig lässt diese Unsicherheit den Dollar als sicheren Hafen attraktiver werden.” Zu einem Währungskorb wertete der Greenback 0,2 Prozent auf und steuert auf seinen stärksten Wochengewinn seit Anfang April zu. Der Euro verlor im Gegenzug 0,4 Prozent an Wert auf 1,1626 Dollar.\n\nDas parteipolitische Gezänk um ein neues US-Konjunkturpaket mache auch Anleihe-Anleger zu schaffen, schrieben die Analysten der Bank Unicredit. Daher würden sich die Bonds vorerst nicht aus ihrer engen Handelsspanne der vergangenen Wochen befreien können. Die zehnjährigen Bundesanleihen rentierten etwas niedriger bei minus 0,526 Prozent.\n\nNIEDRIGZINSEN LASTEN AUF BANKAKTIEN\n\nDie Aussicht auf dauerhaft niedrige Zinsen und geringe Gewinnmargen im Kreditgeschäft vertrieb Anleger aus Finanzwerten. Der europäische Banken-Index fiel um 1,7 Prozent auf ein Rekordtief von 78,89 Punkten, die Papiere der Deutschen Bank notierten 2,2 Prozent schwächer. “Neue Restriktionen in Europa, geringere Unterstützung des Staats, auslaufende Liquiditätsimpulse und Wahl-Risiken sollten auf der Wirtschaft im vierten Quartal lasten”, schrieben die Europa-Experten der Bank Barclays.\n\nAm Pariser Aktienmarkt sorgte ein gut 30-prozentiger Kurssprung von Lagardere für Aufsehen. Damit steuerten die Aktien des Herausgebers der Zeitschrift “Paris Match” auf den größten Tagesgewinn seit mehr als 33 Jahren zu. Zuvor hatte Bernard Arnault, der reichste Mann Frankreichs, seine direkte Beteiligung an dem Unternehmen öffentlich gemacht. Darüber hinaus sei er über ein Investment-Vehikel des Firmenchefs Arnaud Lagardere mit knapp 13 Prozent an dem Konzern beteiligt. Damit stellte sich Arnault gegen den Milliardär Vincent Bollore, der den Medienkonzern Vivendi kontrolliert und das Unternehmen zerschlagen will.\n\nIn Deutschland legte Hensoldt ein enttäuschendes Börsendebüt hin. Die Aktien des Rüstungselektronik-Anbieters notierten mit 10,57 Euro zeitweise zwölf Prozent unter ihrem Ausgabepreis von zwölf Euro, der schon am unteren Ende der Angebotsspanne gelegen hatte.",

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nVereinzelte Hoffnungsschimmer verhinderten allerdings größere Verkäufe. Dax und EuroStoxx50 schlossen am Donnerstag jeweils etwa ein halbes Prozent im Minus bei 12.606,57 und 3159,16 Punkten. Der US-Standardwerteindex Dow Jones hielt sich knapp im Plus.\n\nMut machte Investoren unter anderem die neue Billigkredit-Salve der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB). Dort sicherten sich Geschäftsbanken aus der Euro-Zone 174,5 Milliarden Euro. “Da diese Kredite an Unternehmen und Verbraucher weitergereicht werden müssen, liefert die Nachfrage tiefe Einblicke in die Kreditnachfrage aus der Wirtschaft”, sagte Portfolio-Manager Thomas Altmann vom Vermögensberater QC Partners.\n\nDer Ifo-Index, der die Stimmung in den deutschen Chef-Etagen widerspiegelt, brachte Licht und Schatten, resümierte Thomas Gitzel, Chef-Volkswirt der VP Bank. “So erbaulich der Anstieg ist, das notorische Haar in der Suppe gibt es dennoch. Über Europa schwappt derzeit eine zweite Corona-Welle.” Die kommenden Quartale blieben daher schwierig.\n\nPOLITIK-QUERELEN IN USA BELASTEN EBENFALLS\n\nVon der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaft sei auch keine Unterstützung zu erwarten, sagte Analyst Ricardo Evangelista vom Brokerhaus ActivTrades. Dort hemme das parteipolitische Tauziehen um die Neubesetzung eines vakanten Postens im Obersten Gerichtshof der USA die Verabschiedung eines dringend benötigten und von der Notenbank Fed geforderten weiteren Konjunkturpakets.\n\nVor diesem Hintergrund flüchteten einige Anleger in “sichere Häfen” wie die Weltleitwährung.

Die Leasingfirma engagierte einen Sonderprüfer, um die vom britischen Investor Fraser Perring erhobenen Betrugsvorwürfe zu klären.\n\nDie Aktien von Cineworld brachen in London sogar um 14 Prozent ein. Wegen der Pandemie-bedingten Filialschließungen häufte die Kinokette einen milliardenschweren Halbjahresverlust an. Angesichts der weiterhin geltenden Corona-Abstandsregeln sei unklar, wann Cineworld wieder profitabel werde, sagte Anlagestratege Michael Hewson vom Brokerhaus CMC Markets.\n\nAn der Wall Street sorgten die Titel von Sunworks und Polar Power mit dreistelligen prozentualen Kurssprüngen für Furore. Die beiden Ökostrom-Spezialisten profitierten von den Plänen des US-Bundesstaates Kalifornien, ab 2035 den Verkauf von Benzin- und Diesel-Fahrzeugen zu verbieten.",

Die Währung fiel am Montag auf ein Rekordtief, ein Dollar kostete 1,8 Prozent mehr und mit 7,7979 Lira so viel wie nie zuvor. “Es besteht die Sorge, dass die Türkei in einen weiteren regionalen Konflikt hineingezogen wird”, sagte Timothy Ash, Experte bei der Vermögensverwaltung BlueBay.\n\nArmenien und Aserbaidschan streiten derzeit um die Region Bergkarabach. Beide Seiten beschossen sich nach Angaben ihrer Verteidigungsministerien auch in der Nacht zu Montag mit schwerem Artilleriefeuer. Die Türkei grenzt an Armenien an, ist aber traditionell mit Aserbaidschan verbündet.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nFrankfurt (Reuters) - Der Chefwechsel bei der Commerzbank kommt an der Börse gut an.\n\nDie Aktien der zweitgrößten deutschen Privatbank gehörten am Montag neben anderen Banktiteln zu den Favoriten der Anleger und legten um fünf Prozent auf 4,20 Euro zu. “Die Nominierung legt den Grundstein für den Umbau der Commerzbank”, sagte ein Händler. Allerdings werde dieser noch eine Weile auf sich warten lassen, da der neue Chef Manfred Knof erst im Januar von Martin Zielke das Ruder übernehme. “Insofern ist es für Enthusiasmus zu früh.” Tatsächlich waren in einem steigenden Gesamtmarkt auch andere Bankaktien bei Anlegern heiß begehrt: Deutsche-Bank-Titel legten um 5,7 Prozent zu, die Papiere der Schweizer Credit Suisse um 3,8 Prozent und die Aktien der britischen HSB gar um 8,6 Prozent.\n\nAnalystin Martina Matouskova von der US-Bank Jefferies hält den neuen Commerzbank-Chef für eine gute Wahl. Knof sei bekannt für seine erfolgreichen Restrukturierung der Allianz Deutschland AG, deren Chef er vor seinem Wechsel zur Deutschen Bank war. Dort habe er das Versicherungsgeschäft digitalisiert und umfassende Sparmaßnahmen durchgesetzt. Er habe deshalb auch Erfahrung im Verhandlen mit den Gewerkschaften. “All diese Eigenschaften wird er brauchen für den Umbau der Commerzbank. Es wird aber kein Sprint werden sondern eher ein Marathon”, schrieb Matouskova in einem Kurzkommentar. Insidern zufolge sind bei der Commerzbank ein weiterer Jobabbau und die Schließung mehrerer hundert Filialen vorgesehen.\n\nDie Gewerkschaft Verdi kündigte an, sie wolle alles dafür tun, dass Knof die Bank selbständig erhalte. “Er muss das Ziel verfolgen, die Commerzbank als unabhängiges Institut weiterzuentwickeln”, sagte Verdi-Vertreter Stefan Wittmann, der für die Arbeitnehmer im Aufsichtsrat der Commerzbank sitzt, dem “Handelsblatt”. Knof gelte als harter Sanierer, aber auch Verdi sei ein harter Verhandler.\n\nDie Commerzbank hatte lange nach einem Nachfolger für Zielke gesucht, der Anfang Juli im Streit mit dem Investor Cerberus das Handtuch geworfen hatte. Wichtige Aktionäre wie der Bund, der seit einer milliardenschweren Rettungsaktion in der Finanzkrise gut 15 Prozent an der Commerzbank hält, und die Fondsgesellschaft Deka begrüßten die Berufung Knofs.",

Sep (Reuters) - Verhaltenes Börsendebüt für Siemens Energy: Der erste Aktienkurs für die abgespaltene Energietechnik-Sparte von Siemens ist an der Frankfurter Börse am Montag mit 22,01 Euro festgestellt worden. Damit kommt das rote Zahlen schreibende Unternehmen auf einen Börsenwert von 16 Milliarden Euro, weit weniger als die Analysten ihm im Schnitt zugetraut haben - und weniger als der Buchwert, den die Wirtschaftsprüfer für Siemens Energy bei der Abspaltung ermittelt hatten. Allein die Beteiligung am Windanlagenbauer Siemens Gamesa - der Zukunftshoffnung bei der Energiewende - ist knapp zehn Milliarden Euro wert. Am Vormittag bröckelten Siemens-Energy-Aktien zeitweise auf weniger als 20 Euro ab.\n\nFür die Siemens-Aktionäre hat sich die Abspaltung (Spin-off) dennoch fürs erste gelohnt. Sie hatten 55 Prozent der Siemens-Energy-Aktien übers Wochenende ins Depot gebucht bekommen - je eine für zwei Siemens-Papiere. Die Aktie des Münchner Technologiekonzerns fiel am Montag nur um 2,4 Prozent auf 109 Euro. Zusammengerechnet ergibt sich für die Anteilseigner ein Kursgewinn von sechs Prozent.\n\nDie Siemens AG konzentriert sich nach der Abspaltung der Energie-Sparte mit den verbleibenden 240.000 Mitarbeitern auf ihre margenstarken Geschäfte mit der Automatisierung von Anlagen und ganzen Fabriken, auf digitale Gebäudetechnik und auf Züge. Sie hofft damit auf höhere Renditen und Aktienkurse. An Siemens Energy behält sie 35,1 Prozent und will ds Aktienpaket binnen 12 bis 18 Monaten in Richtung 25 Prozent abschmelzen. Zusammen mit der Medizintechnik-Sparte Healthineers sind nun drei Unternehmen mit dem Namen Siemens in an der Frankfurter Börse notiert.\n\nSiemens Energy ist der größte “Spin-off” in Deutschland. “Als eigenständiger Konzern haben wir nun die notwendige unternehmerische Flexibilität, um die weltweite Transformation der Energiemärkte nachhaltig und wirtschaftlich erfolgreich mitzugestalten”, sagte Vorstandschef Christian Bruch. Zunächst geht es aber darum, wieder schwarze Zahlen zu schreiben. Mit einer starken Bilanz habe die bisherige Muttergesellschaft “hervorragende Startbedingungen geschaffen”, um Siemens Energy profitabler zu machen, sagte Siemens-Finanzchef Ralf Thomas in Frankfurt.\n\nZuvor hatte Bayer die Töchter Lanxess und Covestro über einen “Spin-off” als eigenständige Firmen an die Börse gebracht. E.ON trennte sich auf dem gleichen Weg von Uniper, Siemens hatte die Aktien von Osram an die eigenen Aktionäre verteilt.\n\nIn Unternehmenskreisen war mit starken Kursschwankungen bei Siemens Energy in den ersten Wochen gerechnet worden. Denn nicht nur Dax-Indexfonds müssen sich von Siemens-Energy-Aktien trennen. Auch Technologie-Anleger dürften aussteigen. Insgesamt könnten 35 Prozent der Siemens-Energy-Aktien in nächster Zeit den Besitzer wechseln. Erst in zwei bis drei Monaten werde man sehen, wie das Unternehmen mit rund 91.000 Mitarbeitern wirklich bewertet werde, hieß es in Siemens-Kreisen.

After Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Angela Merkel's CDU, said she won't run for chancellor, Laschet, the chairman of North-Rhine Westphalia's CDU became one of those spoken of as an alternative for the position. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay REFILE - CORRECTING DECADE\n\nBerlin (Reuters) - Im Rennen um den CDU-Vorsitz plant die Partei zwei gemeinsame öffentliche Auftritte der drei Aspiranten.\n\nDarauf verständigten sich Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz und Norbert Röttgen mit der Parteiführung am Montag in Berlin. Zudem stellen sich die Kandidaten alleine jeweils ein Mal exklusiv den Fragen der Parteimitglieder. “Die Partei will einen fairen Wettbewerb”, erklärte die noch amtierende Vorsitzende Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer nach dem Treffen. “Ich bin mir sicher, dass das mit den drei Kandidaten und den besprochenen Formaten gut gelingt.”\n\nDie CDU will auf ihrem Bundesparteitag am 4. Dezember in Stuttgart ihren neuen Vorsitzenden wählen. Wahlberechtigt sind 1001 Delegierte. Die “Live Talks” der drei Kandidaten, Nordrhein-Westfalens Ministerpräsident Laschet, Ex-Unionsfraktionschef Merz und der Außenpolitiker Röttgen, sollen Anfang und Ende November in der Parteizentrale in Berlin produziert werden. Sie sollen jeweils 90 Minuten dauern und auf der Seite cdu.de übertragen werden. Wegen der Corona-Krise wird es keine Zuschauer geben. Die für CDU-Mitglieder exklusive Einzelbefragung der Kandidaten ist für Mitte November geplant und soll 60 Minuten dauern.\n\nRöttgen äußerte sich als einziger der Drei am Montag zu dem Verfahren und forderte einen fairen und öffentlichen Ablauf. “Ich glaube, es sollte ein transparentes Verfahren geben, ein inhaltlich orientiertes politisches Verfahren, das respektvoll miteinander stattfindet”, sagte er vor Beginn des Treffens. An der Auswahl sollten alle Mitglieder der CDU teilhaben. Sie sollten die Möglichkeit haben, die Akzentunterschiede der Kandidaten auch mitzubekommen.\n\nUnionsfraktionschef Ralph Brinkhaus warnte seine Partei vor einer Kampfkandidatur. “Wir wollen Einigkeit, gerade in der Krise. Denn es geht um Deutschland, nicht um Parteien oder einzelne Egos”, sagte Brinkhaus Zeit online am Montag. “Je näher der Parteitag rückt, desto deutlicher fordern Mitglieder und Bevölkerung Einigkeit in der CDU.” Eine Teamlösung vor dem Parteitag lehnen die Kandidaten bislang aber ab. Röttgen sagte, nach der Entscheidung müsse es eine Mannschaft geben, “und die wird es auch geben”. Der CDU-Vorsitzende hat traditionell den aussichtsreichsten Zugriff auf die Kanzlerkandidatur der Union, die allerdings von der CSU mitentschieden wird.",

Das ist wie in den anderen Ländern”, zitierte “Bild” die Kanzlerin aus einer Videokonferenz des CDU-Präsidiums am Montag. Eine Person mit Kenntnis der Konferenz berichtete gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters ebenfalls davon. Die Kanzlerin habe die Zahl basierend auf Hochrechnungen genannt und als Zeitraum bis Weihnachten angegeben. Das Infektionsgeschehen müsse schnell eingedämmt werden. Dabei müssten Prioritäten gesetzt werden, habe Merkel gesagt. Die Wirtschaft müsse am Laufen gehalten werden, Schulen und Kitas offen bleiben. Fußball sei dagegen sekundär.\n\nAm Dienstag ist eine Videokonferenz der Kanzlerin mit den Ministerpräsidenten der Bundesländer geplant, um das weitere Vorgehen in der Corona-Pandemie zu koordinieren. In Deutschland stieg die Zahl der bekannten Neuinfektionen in den vergangenen 24 Stunden um 1192, wie das Robert-Koch-Institut bekanntgab. Allerdings ist die Zahl zum Wochenanfang oft vergleichsweise niedrig, weil nicht alle Gesundheitsämter über das Wochenende Daten melden. Im Mittel hatten die Neuinfektionen in den vergangenen Tagen um über 2000 zugelegt. Am stärksten nehmen die Fälle derzeit in Frankreich und Spanien mit jeweils über 10.000 Neuinfektionen binnen 24 Stunden zu.\n\nMerkel-Sprecher Steffen Seibert mahnte vor den Beratungen mit den Bundesländern ein konsequentes Handeln an, um einen weiteren Anstieg der Neuinfektionen zu verhindern. “Wir sind alles andere als ohnmächtig.” Es müsse aber beherzt gehandelt werden. Die Neuinfektionen hätten sich seit Juni verdreifacht. Das sehe die Bundesregierung mit großer Sorge, lokal und regional gebe es sogar sprunghafte Anstiege. Wichtig sei es, die Gesundheitsämter bei der Nachverfolgung der Infektionsketten nicht zu überfordern. Sie seien derzeit zum Teil am Anschlag.\n\nDie Pandemie trifft Teile der Wirtschaft extrem hart, etwa den Tourismus. Die dafür zuständigen Minister der EU beraten am Montag per Videoschalte. Die Gesundheit stehe zwar im Vordergrund, erklärte der Tourismusbeauftragte der Bundesregierung, Thomas Bareiß. “Unser Ziel ist es aber, Reisebeschränkungen auf das notwendige Maß zu begrenzen und den Menschen in Europa wieder eine möglichst große Reisefreiheit zu ermöglichen, ohne dabei den Gesundheitsschutz zu vernachlässigen.”",

Sven Hoppe/Pool via REUTERS\n\nMünchen (Reuters) - Bayern hat den Such-Prozess für ein Atommüll-Endlager und den Ausschluss Gorlebens in Niedersachsen kritisiert.\n\n“Wenn man breit angelegt diskutieren möchte, bleibt die Frage, warum man Gorleben fundamental ausschließt”, sagte Ministerpräsident Markus Söder (CSU) am Montag in München. “Das ist eine Schwäche in der Argumentation.” Die Bundesgesellschaft für Endlagerung (BGE) habe dies nicht ausreichend begründet. Für die Erkundung des Salzstocks seien jahrzehntelange Arbeit aufgewendet und nun viele Milliarden Euro verschwendet worden. Er verwies darauf, dass die BGE zwei Drittel von Bayern als grundsätzlich geeignet halte und deutschlandweit mehr als die Hälfte der Fläche. “Ich befürchte, dass sehr viele Menschen jetzt sehr verunsichert sind.” Allein in Bayern betreffe dies acht Millionen.\n\nUnverständlich nannte es Söder auch, dass ein Endlager für eine Million Jahre ausgelegt werden soll. Das sei eine “mutige und interessante Einschätzung”. Die Gesteinsart Granit, die vor allem in Bayern vorkommt, sei dafür nicht sinnvoll.\n\nDennoch sagte Söder, Bayern werde sich nicht grundsätzlich bei der Suche verweigern. “Wir werden keine Totalblockade machen. Wir ducken uns auch nicht weg.” Man werde sich konstruktiv auch mit Wissenschaftlern aus Bayern einbringen.\n\nDie BGE hat allein aufgrund geologischer Bedingungen rund 90 mögliche Gebiete in Ton-, Salz- und kristallinen Gesteinformationen wie Granit aufgelistet. Andere Kriterien wie Besiedlung oder Bebauung spielten in diesem ersten Schritt noch keine Rolle. In weiteren Phasen soll die Auswahl in den nächsten Jahren weiter eingeschränkt werden, so dass bis 2031 eine Entscheidung für einen Standort fallen kann. 2050 soll das Lager dann in Betrieb gehen.",

REUTERS/Staff/File Photo/File Photo\n\nJerewan/Baku (Reuters) - Trotz internationaler Appelle zur Zurückhaltung gehen die Kämpfe zwischen Armenien und Aserbaidschan um die Region Bergkarabach weiter.\n\nDie beiden ehemaligen Sowjet-Republiken beschossen sich nach Angaben ihrer Verteidigungsministerien auch am Montag mit Artilleriefeuer. Bergkarabach sprach von 28 weiteren Toten auf seiner Seite, seit Sonntag sind es demnach 59. Laut Agentur Interfax wurden zudem rund 200 Armenier verletzt. Aserbaidschan meldete sechs Tote und 19 Verletzte und ordnete eine Teil-Mobilmachung an. In Armenien gilt dies schon seit Sonntag. Zudem haben beide Länder Kriegsrecht verhängt. Die schwersten Kämpfe um die Region seit 2016 waren am Sonntag wieder aufgeflammt, wofür sich beide Länder gegenseitig die Schuld gaben. Armenien hat ein Verteidigungsbündnis mit Russland, die Türkei ist ein Verbündeter Aserbaidschans.\n\nChina und Russland forderten beide Länder zur Beendigung der Kämpfe und zum Dialog auf. Die Bundesregierung sprach von einer “gefährlichen Lage”. Es müsse einen Waffenstillstand und sofortige Verhandlungen geben.\n\nBeide Konfliktparteien warfen sich vor, ausländische Unterstützung zu erhalten. Die Agentur Interfax zitierte den armenischen Botschafter in Russland mit den Worten, die Türkei habe rund 4000 Kämpfer aus Nordsyrien nach Aserbaidschan geschickt. Dem armenischen Außenministerium zufolge kämpfen türkische Militärexperten “Seite an Seite” mit Aserbaidschanern. Der Nachbar wies die Vorwürfe zurück. Der türkische Verteidigungsminister Hulusi Akar sagte zudem, Armenien müsse die “Söldner und Terroristen” zurückschicken, die es von Außen in die Region gebracht habe.\n\nDer türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan forderte, Armenien müsse sich sofort von aserbaidschanischem Land zurückziehen. Am Sonntag hatte er dem Präsidenten von Aserbaidschan, Ilham Alijew, bereits “verstärkte” Solidarität zugesagt. Russlands Präsident Wladimir Putin hatte mit dem armenischen Ministerpräsidenten Nikol Paschinjan telefoniert. Dieser hatte die internationale Staatengemeinschaft aufgefordert, eine Einmischung der Türkei in den Konflikt zu verhindern.\n\nBeide Seiten werfen sich gegenseitig vor, für die Eskalation verantwortlich zu sein. Aserbaidschan hatte erklärt, Armenien habe Bergkarabach aus der Luft und mit Artillerie beschossen. Die eigenen Truppen hätten daraufhin Panzer, Hubschrauber und Drohnen der gegnerischen Seite zerstört. Aserbaidschan erklärte indes, man habe auf einen armenischen Angriff reagiert.\n\nArmenien und Aserbaidschan streiten seit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion über die Zugehörigkeit von Bergkarabach, das zu Aserbaidschan gehört - aber hauptsächlich von Armeniern bewohnt wird und sich 1991 von Aserbaidschan lossagte. Der Westen und die Länder der Region sehen den Konflikt mit Sorge, da er den Südkaukasus destabilisieren könnte. Dort verlaufen wichtige Öl- und Gaspipelines. Obwohl das mehrheitlich christliche Armenien und das mehrheitlich muslimische Aserbaidschan 1994 einen Waffenstillstand schlossen, werfen sie sich regelmäßig gegenseitig Angriffe rund um Bergkarabach mit seinen rund 150.000 Einwohnern und entlang der gemeinsamen Grenze vor. Dabei hatte es wiederholt auch Tote gegeben.",

Le gouvernement a présenté lundi un projet de budget pour 2021 destiné à sortir la France de sa pire récession depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale avec l'injection, dès l'année prochaine, de 42 milliards d'euros dans l'économie sur les 100 milliards de son plan de relance. /Photo prise le 28 septembre 2020/REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nLe gouvernement prévoit une contraction de 10% du produit intérieur brut (PIB) cette année en raison de la crise provoquée par le nouveau coronavirus, qui a paralysé l’activité pendant les deux mois du confinement de la population au printemps. La France, deuxième économie de la zone euro, subit ainsi l’une des plus fortes récessions en Europe.\n\nParis a déjà mobilisé plus de 470 milliards d’euros en reports ou exonérations de taxes, dispositifs de chômage partiel et prêts garantis par l’Etat pour tenter de soutenir les entreprises et les ménages, ce qui a fait bondir le déficit public à 10,2% du PIB cette année.\n\nL’économie française a néanmoins entamé son redressement depuis la levée du confinement et le gouvernement prédit une croissance de 8% l’an prochain, gonflée par un plan de relance de 100 milliards d’euros dont il compte débloquer 42 milliards d’ici fin 2021.\n\n“Nous allons veiller attentivement au décaissement rapide des 42 milliards d’euros”, a dit le ministre de l’Economie, des Finances et de la Relance, Bruno Le Maire, lors de la présentation du projet de loi de finances (PLF) à la presse.\n\nLe Haut Conseil des finances publiques (HCFP) a jugé “prudente” la prévision d’activité pour 2020 et de “volontariste” l’ampleur du rebond anticipé pour l’année prochaine, en soulignant les incertitudes “exceptionnellement élevées” liées à la crise sanitaire. Il considère aussi que l’objectif de déficit public (6,7% du PIB l’an prochain après 10,2% cette année) est “atteignable”.\n\nLa crise du COVID-19 a creusé un trou de plus de 100 milliards d’euros dans les caisses de l’Etat, faisant grimper le déficit à 195 milliards cette année.\n\nLa dette devrait en conséquence gonfler elle aussi pour atteindre 117,5% du PIB cette année, après un peu moins de 100% l’an dernier, avant de refluer légèrement à 116,2% en 2021.\n\nBruno Le Maire a déclaré que cette dette serait remboursée par la croissance économique, par une gestion saine des finances publiques et par la poursuite de réformes structurelles.\n\nLe ministre de l’Economie a souligné l’importance du soutien apporté par la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) via sa politique monétaire de taux ultra-bas et d’achats de titres massifs sur les marchés, qui permettent de maintenir le coût de l’emprunt à un niveau très faible.\n\n“Si nous pouvons engager ce plan de relance et si nous pouvons considérer la dette comme un investissement, c’est aussi parce que nous avons une politique monétaire de la BCE qui le permet et qui nous protège”, a-t-il dit.",

L’Arménie et le Haut-Karabakh ont instauré la loi martiale et mobilisé leur population masculine.\n\nL’Azerbaïdjan, qui a lui aussi instauré la loi martiale, a assuré que ses forces avaient répondu à des bombardements arméniens et qu’elles avaient pris le contrôle de sept villages, bien que le Haut-Karabakh l’ait démenti. Le bureau du procureur azerbaïdjanais a déclaré que cinq membres d’une même famille avaient été tués par les bombardements arméniens.\n\nDes militants des droits de l’homme arméniens ont en outre déclaré qu’une femme et un enfant d’origine arménienne avaient été tués.\n\nSelon l’Arménie, qui a promis une “réponse proportionnée”, les forces azéries ont attaqué des cibles civiles dont la capitale du Haut-Karabakh, Stepanakert.\n\n“Nous restons forts au côté de notre armée pour protéger notre patrie de l’invasion azérie”, a écrit le Premier ministre arménien Nikol Pashinyan sur Twitter.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nL’Azerbaïdjan a démenti une déclaration du ministère arménien de la Défense affirmant que des hélicoptères et des chars azéris avaient été détruits et a accusé les forces arméniennes de lancer des attaques “délibérées et ciblées” le long de la ligne de front.\n\n“Nous défendons notre territoire, notre cause est juste”, a dit le président azéri, Ilham Aliyev, dans un discours à la nation.\n\nLA FRANCE SE DIT “VIVEMENT PRÉOCCUPÉE”\n\nLes affrontements ont provoqué une vague de réactions diplomatiques pour empêcher une nouvelle flambée d’un conflit vieux de plusieurs décennies entre l’Arménie à majorité chrétienne et l’Azerbaïdjan principalement musulman, la Russie appelant à un cessez-le-feu immédiat et une autre puissance régionale, la Turquie, affirmant qu’elle soutiendrait l’Azerbaïdjan.\n\nLe président russe Vladimir Poutine s’est entretenu par téléphone avec Nikol Pashinyan mais aucun détail de la conversation n’a filtré, tandis que le président turc Tayyip Erdogan a parlé avec Ilham Aliyev.\n\nDes pipelines transportant du pétrole et du gaz naturel de la mer Caspienne de l’Azerbaïdjan passent près du Haut-Karabakh. L’Arménie a également mis en garde contre les risques sécuritaires dans le Caucase du Sud en juillet après que l’Azerbaïdjan a menacé d’attaquer la centrale nucléaire arménienne.\n\nLa France s’est dite vivement préoccupée par les affrontements et a appelé les deux camps à cesser immédiatement les hostilités et à reprendre le dialogue, selon un communiqué du ministère des Affaires étrangères.\n\n“La France est vivement préoccupée par les affrontements d’ampleur en cours au Haut-Karabakh et les informations faisant état notamment de victimes parmi la population civile. Elle appelle à cesser immédiatement les hostilités et à reprendre le dialogue”, a dit la porte-parole du Quai d’Orsay.\n\n“En sa qualité de coprésidente du groupe de Minsk, la France, avec ses partenaires russe et américain, réitère son engagement en vue de parvenir à un règlement négocié et durable du conflit du Haut-Karabakh, dans le respect du droit international”, a-t-elle ajouté.\n\nLa France fait partie du groupe de Minsk chargé de la médiation entre l’Arménie et l’Azerbaïdjan.\n\nAu Vatican, le Pape François a déclaré de son côté “(qu’il priait) pour la paix au Caucase et (qu’il demandait) aux parties en conflit de faire des gestes de bonne volonté et de fraternité pouvant conduire à la résolution des problèmes, pas en utilisant la force et les armes, mais à travers le dialogue et les négociations”.",

Où se situe la trajectoire du développement s’il n’y a pas un tel ancrage?”, a déclaré une source concernée par le débat.\n\nLes économistes et les groupes de réflexion ont proposé un objectif de croissance annuelle du produit intérieur brut (PIB) d’environ 5% en moyenne, dans une fourchette de 5% à 5,5% et de 5% à 6%, selon les sources.\n\nLa Chine vise une croissance annuelle moyenne de plus de 6,5% pour le 13e plan quinquennal qui s’achève cette année.\n\nLe bureau d’information du Conseil d’Etat chinois n’a pas répondu dans l’immédiat à une demande de commentaires.\n\nCertains conseillers du gouvernement estiment que la Chine devrait mettre fin aux objectifs officiels de croissance afin d’encourager des investissements davantage productifs et ne plus dépendre des mesures de relance alimentées par la dette.\n\nEn mai, la Chine s’est abstenue pour la première fois en 18 ans de fixer un objectif de croissance annuelle en raison de la crise sanitaire liée au coronavirus. Certains économistes suspectent cependant le gouvernement d’avoir maintenu un objectif implicite d’environ 3%.\n\nLe nouveau plan quinquennal devrait être dévoilé début 2021 à l’ouverture de la session annuelle de l’Assemblée nationale populaire (ANP), le Parlement chinois. L’objectif de croissance pour l’année 2021 en elle-même devrait être fixé par les principaux dirigeants lors d’une conférence économique annuelle en décembre.\n\n“Nous nous attendons à ce que le gouvernement ne fixe pas d’objectif de croissance explicite ou fixe un objectif de croissance plus bas et plus souple (par exemple autour de 5%)” pour 2021-2025, écrivent dans une note les analystes d’UBS.\n\nLa Chine fait face à de nombreux obstacles pour maintenir son rythme de croissance dans un contexte de tensions accrues avec les Etats-Unis sur le commerce, les nouvelles technologies et d’autres domaines.\n\n“Le 14e plan quinquennal sera un moment critique pour la Chine face au conflit avec les Etats-Unis et dans la perspective de décisions stratégiques”, souligne dans un rapport le Centre de recherche de développement (DRC) qui conseille le gouvernement.\n\nLes analystes s’attendent à ce que le PIB de la Chine augmente de 2% à 3% en 2020, le rythme le plus faible depuis 1976. Ils estiment en outre, que malgré un possible rebond de plus 7% en 2021, la tendance à long terme pointe vers une croissance plus lente liée au vieillissement de la population et à la maturité de l’économie.",

Le communiqué ne fait pas mention des discussions en cours sur ses activités aux Etats-Unis.\n\nCette démarche intervient environ un mois après que la Chine a revu, pour la première fois en 12 ans, la liste des technologies soumises à des interdictions ou des restrictions en matière de transfert à l’étranger, avec des modifications qui, selon des experts, permettent au gouvernement chinois d’avoir son mot à dire sur tout accord concernant TikTok.\n\nByteDance a indiqué par le passé que l’accord négocié pour les activités de l’application vidéo aux Etats-Unis devait être validé par Pékin et par Washington.\n\nLa presse officielle chinoise a écrit dans la semaine qu’il n’y avait aucune raison pour que Pékin valide l’accord conclu par ByteDance avec Oracle et Walmart, dénonçant le “harcèlement” de Washington.",
